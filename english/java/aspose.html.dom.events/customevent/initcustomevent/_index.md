## CustomEvent.InitCustomEvent method

/// The [`InitEvent`](../../event/initevent/) method is used to initialize the value of an [`Event`](../../event/) created through the [`IDocumentEvent`](../../idocumentevent/) interface.

```java
public void InitCustomEvent(String type, bool bubbles, bool cancelable, object detail)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| type | String | The event type. |
| bubbles | Boolean | if set to `true` [bubbles]. |
| cancelable | Boolean | if set to `true` [cancelable]. |
| detail | Object | The custom data. |

## Remarks

This method may only be called before the Event has been dispatched via the [`DispatchEvent`](../../ieventtarget/dispatchevent/) method, though it may be called multiple times during that phase if necessary. If called multiple times the final invocation takes precedence. If called from a subclass of Event interface only the values specified in the initEvent method are modified, all other attributes are left unchanged.
