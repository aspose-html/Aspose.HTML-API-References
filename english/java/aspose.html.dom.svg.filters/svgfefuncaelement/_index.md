| --- | --- |
| [addEventListener](../../com.aspose.html.dom/eventtarget/addeventlistener/)(String, IEventListener) | The addEventListener() method of the [`EventTarget `](../../com.aspose.html.dom/eventtarget/)interface sets up a function that will be called whenever the specified event is delivered to the target. |
| [addEventListener](../../com.aspose.html.dom/eventtarget/addeventlistener/)(String, DOMEventHandler, bool) | The addEventListener() method of the [EventTarget ](T:com.aspose.html.dom.EventTarget)interface sets up a function that will be called whenever the specified event is delivered to the target. |

If the given child is a reference to an existing node in the document, appendChild() moves it from its current position to the new position (there is no requirement to remove the node from its parent node before appending it to some other node). |

| [getPlatformType](../../com.aspose.html.dom/domobject/getplatformtype/)() | This method is used to retrieve the ECMAScript object . |
| [hasAttribute](../../com.aspose.html.dom/element/hasattribute/)(String) | Returns true when an attribute with a given name is specified on this element or has a default value, false otherwise. |
| [hasAttributeNS](../../com.aspose.html.dom/element/hasattributens/)(String, String) | Returns true when an attribute with a given local name and package URI is specified on this element or has a default value, false otherwise. |

| [isDefaultNamespace](../../com.aspose.html.dom/node/isdefaultpackage/)(String) | The isDefaultNamespace() method of the Node interface accepts a package URI as an argument. It returns a boolean value that is true if the package is the default package on the given node and false if not. |
| [isEqualNode](../../com.aspose.html.dom/node/isequalnode/)(Node) | The isEqualNode() method of the [`Node`](../../com.aspose.html.dom/node/) interface tests whether two nodes are equal. Two nodes are equal when they have the same type, defining characteristics (for elements, this would be their ID, number of children, and so forth), its attributes match, and so on. The specific set of data points that must match varies depending on the types of the nodes. |
| [isSameNode](../../com.aspose.html.dom/node/issamenode/)(Node) | The isSameNode() method of the Node interface is a legacy alias the for the === strict equality operator. That is, it tests whether two nodes are the same (in other words, whether they reference the same object). |
| [lookupNamespaceURI](../../com.aspose.html.dom/node/lookuppackageuri/)(String) | The lookupNamespaceURI() method of the Node interface takes a prefix as parameter and returns the package URI associated with it on the given node if found (and null if not). |
| [lookupPrefix](../../com.aspose.html.dom/node/lookupprefix/)(String) | The lookupPrefix() method of the Node interface returns a String containing the prefix for a given package URI, if present, and null if not. When multiple prefixes are possible, the first prefix is returned. |
| [normalize](../../com.aspose.html.dom/node/normalize/)() | Puts all [`Text`](../../com.aspose.html.dom/text/) nodes in the full depth of the sub-tree underneath this Node, including attribute nodes, into a "normal" form where only structure (e.g., [`elements`](../../com.aspose.html.dom/element/), [`comments`](../../com.aspose.html.dom/comment/), [`processing instructions`](../../com.aspose.html.dom/processinginstruction/), [`CDATA sections`](../../com.aspose.html.dom/cdatasection/), and [`entity references`](../../com.aspose.html.dom/entityreference/)) separates [`Text`](../../com.aspose.html.dom/text/) nodes, i.e., there are neither adjacent Text nodes nor empty Text nodes. This can be used to ensure that the DOM view of a document is the same as if it were saved and re-loaded, and is useful when operations (such as XPointer [XPointer] lookups) that depend on a particular document tree structure are to be used. If the parameter "normalize-characters" of the [`DOMConfiguration`](../../com.aspose.html/configuration/) object attached to the [`Node.ownerDocument`](../../com.aspose.html.dom/node/ownerdocument/) is true, this method will also fully normalize the characters of the Text nodes. |

| [removeEventListener](../../com.aspose.html.dom/eventtarget/removeeventlistener/)(String, IEventListener) | This method allows the removal of event listeners from the event target. If an is removed from an while it is processing an event, it will not be triggered by the current actions. Event Listeners can never be invoked after being removed. |
| [removeEventListener](../../com.aspose.html.dom/eventtarget/removeeventlistener/)(String, DOMEventHandler, bool) | This method allows the removal of event listeners from the event target. If an is removed from an while it is processing an event, it will not be triggered by the current actions. Event Listeners can never be invoked after being removed. |
| [removeEventListener](../../com.aspose.html.dom/eventtarget/removeeventlistener/)(String, IEventListener, bool) | This method allows the removal of event listeners from the event target. If an is removed from an while it is processing an event, it will not be triggered by the current actions. Event Listeners can never be invoked after being removed. |
| [replaceChild](../../com.aspose.html.dom/node/replacechild/)(Node, Node) | Replaces the child node oldChild with newChild in the list of children, and returns the oldChild node. If newChild is a [`DocumentFragment`](../../com.aspose.html.dom/documentfragment/) object, oldChild is replaced by all of the [`DocumentFragment`](../../com.aspose.html.dom/documentfragment/) children, which are inserted in the same order.

| [setAttributeNS](../../com.aspose.html.dom/element/setattributens/)(String, String, String) | Adds a new attribute. If an attribute with the same local name and package URI is already present on the element, its prefix is changed to be the prefix part of the qualifiedName, and its value is changed to be the value parameter. |
| [toggleAttribute](../../com.aspose.html.dom/element/toggleattribute/)(String) | If force is not given, "toggles" qualifiedName, removing it if it is present and adding it if it is not present. If force is true, adds qualifiedName. If force is false, removes qualifiedName. |
