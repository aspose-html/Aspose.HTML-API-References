## NodeFilter.SHOW_ATTRIBUTE field

Show Attr nodes. This is meaningful only when creating an iterator or tree-walker with an attribute node as its root; in this case, it means that the attribute node will appear in the first position of the iteration or traversal. Since attributes are never children of other nodes, they do not appear when traversing over the document tree.

```java
public const long SHOW_ATTRIBUTE;
```
