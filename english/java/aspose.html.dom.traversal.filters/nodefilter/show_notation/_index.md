## NodeFilter.SHOW_NOTATION field

Show Notation nodes. This is meaningful only when creating an iterator or tree-walker with a Notation node as its root; in this case, it means that the Notation node will appear in the first position of the traversal. Since notations are not part of the document tree, they do not appear when traversing over the document tree.

```java

```
