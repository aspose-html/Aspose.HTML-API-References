## RGBColor.Red property

Gets the red component value of this Color structure.

```java
public CSSPrimitiveValue Red { get; }
```

### Property Value

The red component value of this Color.

## Remarks

The color of each pixel is represented as a 32-bit number: 8 bits each for alpha, red, green, and blue (ARGB). The alpha component specifies the transparency of the color: 0 is fully transparent, and 255 is fully opaque. Likewise, an A value of 255 represents an opaque color. An A value from 1 through 254 represents a semitransparent color. The color becomes more opaque as A approaches 255.
