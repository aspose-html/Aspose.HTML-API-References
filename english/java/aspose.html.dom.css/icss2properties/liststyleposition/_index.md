## ICSS2Properties.ListStylePosition property

This property specifies the position of the marker box in the principal block box. Values have the following meanings:

outside - The marker box is outside the principal block box. Note. CSS1 did not specify the precise location of the marker box and for reasons of compatibility, CSS2 remains equally ambiguous. For more precise control of marker boxes, please use markers.inside - The marker box is the first inline box in the principal block box, after which the element's content flows.

```java
public String ListStylePosition { get; set; }
```

### Return Value
