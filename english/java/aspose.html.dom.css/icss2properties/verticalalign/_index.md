This property affects the vertical positioning inside a line box of the boxes generated by an inline-level element. The following values only have meaning with respect to a parent inline-level element, or to a parent block-level element, if that element generates [anonymous inline boxes](https://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512/visuren.html#anonymous); they have no effect if no such parent exists.

Note. Values of this property have slightly different meanings in the context of tables. Please consult the section on [table height algorithms](https://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512/tables.html#height-layout) for details. baseline - Align the baseline of the box with the baseline of the parent box. If the box doesn't have a baseline, align the bottom of the box with the parent's baseline.middle - Align the vertical midpoint of the box with the baseline of the parent box plus half the x-height of the parent.sub - Lower the baseline of the box to the proper position for subscripts of the parent's box. (This value has no effect on the font size of the element's text.)super - Raise the baseline of the box to the proper position for superscripts of the parent's box. (This value has no effect on the font size of the element's text.)text-top - Align the top of the box with the top of the parent element's font.text-bottom - Align the bottom of the box with the bottom of the parent element's font.'[percentage](https://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512/syndata.html#value-def-percentage)' - Raise (positive value) or lower (negative value) the box by this distance (a percentage of the ['line-height'](https://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512/visudet.html#propdef-line-height) value). The value '0%' means the same as 'baseline'.'[length](https://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512/syndata.html#value-def-length)' - Raise (positive value) or lower (negative value) the box by this distance.
