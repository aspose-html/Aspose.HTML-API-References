## ICSSValueList.Length property

The length read-only property of the CSSValueList interface represents the number of CSSValues in the list. The range of valid values of the indices is 0 to length-1 inclusive.

```java
public int Length { get; }
```

### Property Value

An unsigned long representing the number of CSSValues.

## Remarks

This feature was originally defined in the [DOM Style Level 2](https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style) specification, but has been dropped from any standardization effort since then.

It has been superseded by a modern, but incompatible, [CSS Typed Object Model API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSS_Typed_OM_API) that is now on the standard track.
