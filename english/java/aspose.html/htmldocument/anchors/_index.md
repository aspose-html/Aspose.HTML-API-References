## HTMLDocument.Anchors property

A collection of all the anchor (`A`) elements in a document with a value for the `name` attribute. For reasons of backward compatibility, the returned set of anchors only contains those anchors created with the `name` attribute, not those created with the `id` attribute. Note that in [[XHTML 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/REC-xhtml1-20020801)], the `name` attribute (see section 4.10) has no semantics and is only present for legacy user agents: the `id` attribute is used instead. Users should prefer the iterator mechanisms provided by [[DOM Level 2 Traversal](http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-DOM-Level-2-Traversal-Range-20001113)] instead.

```java
public HTMLCollection Anchors { get; }
```
