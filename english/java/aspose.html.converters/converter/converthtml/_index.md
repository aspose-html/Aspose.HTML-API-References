PDF conversion

Portable Document Format (PDF) is a type of document created by Adobe back in 1990s. The purpose of this file format was to introduce a standard for representation of documents and other reference material in a format that is independent of application software, hardware as well as Operating System. A PDF file is a set of bytes that can be grouped in to tokens according to syntax rules defined by PDF specifications. Once or more tokens are combined to form higher-level syntactic entities, principally objects, which are the basic data values from which a PDF document is constructed.

PDF conversion

Portable Document Format (PDF) is a type of document created by Adobe back in 1990s.
