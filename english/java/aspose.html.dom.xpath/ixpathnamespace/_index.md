## IXPathNamespace interface

The XPathNamespace interface is returned by XPathResult interfaces to represent the XPath package node type that DOM lacks.

```java
public interface IXPathNamespace
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [getOwnerElement](../../com.aspose.html.dom.xpath/ixpathpackage/ownerelement/) The [`Element`](../../com.aspose.html.dom/element/) on which the package was in scope when it was requested. This does not change on a returned package node even if the document changes such that the package goes out of scope on that element and this node is no longer found there by XPath. |
