Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language that allows authors and users to attach style (e.g., fonts and spacing) to structured documents (e.g., HTML documents and XML applications). It supports media-specific style sheets so that authors may tailor the presentation of their documents to visual browsers, aural devices, printers, braille devices, handheld devices, etc. It also supports content positioning, table layout, features for internationalization and some properties related to user interface. By separating the presentation style of documents from the content of documents, CSS simplifies Web authoring and site maintenance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Filters are objects that know how to "filter out" nodes. If a node iterator or tree walker is given a node filter, it applies the filter before it returns the next node. If the filter says to accept the node, the traversal logic returns it; otherwise, traversal looks for the next node and pretends that the node that was rejected was not there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
