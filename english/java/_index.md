| [com.aspose.html](./aspose.html/) | The Aspose.Html package contains classes and methods to manipulate [`HTML documents`](aspose.html/htmldocument/), whether simple or complex and on the fly. Aspose.HTML for Java allows developers to Insert, Remove, Replace HTML nodes, extract CSS style information, Navigate through [`HTML document`](aspose.html/htmldocument/) either by [`NodeIterator`](aspose.html.dom.traversal/inodeiterator/), [`TreeWalker`](aspose.html.dom.traversal/itreewalker/) that are provided by Traversal Specifications, XPath or CSS selector queries. It also offers the scripting which allows to manipulate HTML DOM via JavaScript. As well as HTML, this API also provides the capabilities to load EPUB and MHTML. Aspose APIs are famous for their inter file format conversion features and this API also provides the capabilities to load HTML file and render the output in PDF, XPS and raster image formats including JPEG, PNG, BMP and TIFF. |
| [com.aspose.html.accessibility](./aspose.html.accessibility/) | The **com.aspose.html.accessibility** package is for all Web Accessibility related manipulations. complies with international standards W3C Web Accessibility Initiative |

| [com.aspose.html.accessibility.saving](./aspose.html.accessibility.saving/) | The **com.aspose.html.accessibility.saving** package is designed to save validation results various formats. |
| [com.aspose.html.collections](./aspose.html.collections/) | The **com.aspose.html.collections** package consists of classes to represent, store and manipulate nodes and elements. |
| [com.aspose.html.converters](./aspose.html.converters/) | The **com.aspose.html.converters** package goal is easy access to conversion methods. It provides a wide range of conversions to the popular formats, such as PDF, XPS, image formats, etc. More specific conversion (rendering, saving) user cases are presented by well known and documented low level API functions in subject oriented packages. |
| [com.aspose.html.diagnostics](./aspose.html.diagnostics/) | The **com.aspose.html.diagnostics** package contains interfaces for working with metrics and collecting logs and traces. |
| [com.aspose.html.dom](./aspose.html.dom/) | The **com.aspose.html.dom (Document Object Model)** package provides API that represents and interacts with any HTML, XML or SVG documents. The DOM is a document model loaded in the browser and representing the document as a node tree, where each node represents part of the document (e.g. an element, text String, or comment). |
| [com.aspose.html.dom.attributes](./aspose.html.dom.attributes/) | The **com.aspose.html.dom.attributes** package contains unified attribute classes which specifies or qualifies any object (node, element, ...) feature or behavior. |
| [com.aspose.html.dom.canvas](./aspose.html.dom.canvas/) |  |
| [com.aspose.html.dom.css](./aspose.html.dom.css/) | Provides interfaces for DOM Level 2 Style Specification. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language that allows authors and users to attach style (e.g., fonts and spacing) to structured documents (e.g., HTML documents and XML applications). It supports media-specific style sheets so that authors may tailor the presentation of their documents to visual browsers, aural devices, printers, braille devices, handheld devices, etc. It also supports content positioning, table layout, features for internationalization and some properties related to user interface. By separating the presentation style of documents from the content of documents, CSS simplifies Web authoring and site maintenance. |
| [com.aspose.html.dom.events](./aspose.html.dom.events/) | The **com.aspose.html.dom.events** package provides objects for any events related DOM updating. It includes subscription to specific contextual information observation associated with event as well as custom events construction. |

| [com.aspose.html.dom.traversal](./aspose.html.dom.traversal/) | The **com.aspose.html.dom.traversal** package contains methods that create iterators and tree-walkers to navigate between elements and traverse a node and its children in document order. |
| [com.aspose.html.dom.traversal.filters](./aspose.html.dom.traversal.filters/) | The package represented by node filtering functionality. Filters are objects that know how to "filter out" nodes. If a node iterator or tree walker is given a node filter, it applies the filter before it returns the next node. If the filter says to accept the node, the traversal logic returns it; otherwise, traversal looks for the next node and pretends that the node that was rejected was not there. |
