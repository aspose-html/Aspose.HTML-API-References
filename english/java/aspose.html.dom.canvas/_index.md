## Classes

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Path2D](./path2d/) | The Path2D interface of the Canvas 2D API is used to declare paths that are then later used on CanvasRenderingContext2D objects. The path methods of the CanvasRenderingContext2D interface are present on this interface as well and are allowing you to create paths that you can retain and replay as required on a canvas. |
## Interfaces

| Interface | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [ICanvasDrawingStyles](./icanvasdrawingstyles/) | The ICanvasDrawingStyles interface provides methods and properties control how lines are drawn and how text is laid out. |
| [ICanvasGradient](./icanvasgradient/) | Represents an opaque object describing a gradient. |
| [ICanvasPathMethods](./icanvaspathmethods/) | The ICanvasPathMethods interface is used to manipulate paths of objects. |
| [ICanvasPattern](./icanvaspattern/) | Represents an opaque object describing a pattern, based on an image, a canvas or a video. |
| [ICanvasRenderingContext2D](./icanvasrenderingcontext2d/) | The ICanvasRenderingContext2D interface is used for drawing rectangles, text, images and other objects onto the canvas element. It provides the 2D rendering context for the drawing surface of a canvas element. |
| [IImageData](./iimagedata/) | Creates an ImageData object from a given Uint8ClampedArray and the size of the image it contains. If no array is given, it creates an image of a black rectangle. |
| [ITextMetrics](./itextmetrics/) | Represents the dimension of a text in the canvas. |
