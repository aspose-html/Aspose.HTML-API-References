The **Aspose.Html.Dom (Document Object Model)**  namespace provides API that
represents and interacts with any HTML, XML or SVG documents.
The DOM is a document model loaded in the browser and
representing the document as a node tree, where each node
represents part of the document (e.g. an element, text string, or comment).

### Classes
| Class | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`Attr`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/attr) | The Attr interface represents an attribute in an Element object. Typically the allowable values for the attribute are defined in a schema associated with the document. |
| [`CDATASection`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/cdatasection) | CDATA sections are used to escape blocks of text containing characters that would otherwise be regarded as markup. |
| [`CharacterData`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/characterdata) | The CharacterData extends Node with a set of attributes and methods for accessing character data in the DOM. |
| [`Comment`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/comment) | Inherits from CharacterData and represents the content of a comment, i.e., all the characters between the starting ''. |
| [`DOMException`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/domexception) | The DOMException interface represents an abnormal event (called an exception) which occurs as a result of calling a method or accessing a property of a web API. This is basically how error conditions are described in web APIs. |
| [`DOMObject`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/domobject) | The DOMObject type is used to represent an base object for the entire Document Object Model.<br/>For Java and ECMAScript, DOMObject is bound to the Object type. |
| [`Document`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/document) | The Document represents the entire HTML, XML or SVG document. Conceptually, it is the root of the document tree, and provides the primary access to the document's data. |
| [`DocumentFragment`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/documentfragment) | DocumentFragment is a "lightweight" or "minimal" Document object. It is very common to want to be able to extract a portion of a document's tree or to create a new fragment of a document. |
| [`DocumentType`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/documenttype) | The DocumentType provides an interface to the list of entities that are defined for the document |
| [`Element`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/element) | The Element interface represents an element in an HTML or XML document. |
| [`Entity`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/entity) | Represents a known entity, either parsed or unparsed, in an XML document. |
| [`EntityReference`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/entityreference) | EntityReference nodes may be used to represent an entity reference in the tree. |
| [`EventTarget`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/eventtarget) | The [`EventTarget`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/eventtarget) interface is implemented by all Nodes in an implementation which supports the DOM Event Model.<br/>Therefore, this interface can be obtained by using binding-specific casting methods on an instance of the Node interface.<br/>The interface allows registration and removal of Event Listeners on an [`EventTarget`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/eventtarget) and dispatch of events to that [`IEventTarget`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.events/ieventtarget). |
| [`IBrowsingContext`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/ibrowsingcontext) | A browsing context is an environment in which [`Document`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/document) objects are presented to the user. |
| [`IChildNode`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/ichildnode) | Defines [`IChildNode`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/ichildnode) interface that should be implemented by [`Node`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/node) that can have a parent. |
| [`IDOMImplementation`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/idomimplementation) | The DOMImplementation interface provides a number of methods for performing operations that are independent of any particular instance of the document object model. |
| [`IGlobalEventHandlers`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/iglobaleventhandlers) | Represents interface that must be inherited by all element that is supported system event handling |
| [`INonDocumentTypeChildNode`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/inondocumenttypechildnode) | Defines [`IChildNode`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/ichildnode) that are not [`Node.DOCUMENT_TYPE_NODE`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/node). |
| [`INonElementParentNode`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/inonelementparentnode) | Defines [`IParentNode`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/iparentnode) that are not Element type. |
| [`IParentNode`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/iparentnode) | Defines the [`IParentNode`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/iparentnode) interface that is implemented by any possible parents. |
| [`IStorage`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/istorage) | This interface of the Web Storage API provides access to a particular domain's session or local storage.<br/>See Web Storage specification: |
| [`Node`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/node) | The Node interface is the primary datatype for the entire Document object Model. It represents a single node in the document tree. |
| [`Notation`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/notation) | Represents a notation declared in the DTD. |
| [`ProcessingInstruction`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/processinginstruction) | The ProcessingInstruction represents a "processing instruction", used in XML as a way to keep processor-specific information in the text of the document. |
| [`QualifiedName`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/qualifiedname) | Represents an HTML qualified name. |
| [`ShadowRoot`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/shadowroot) | ShadowRoot is a root node of shadow tree. |
| [`Text`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/text) | The Text interface inherits from CharacterData and represents the textual content (termed character data in XML) of an Element or Attr. |
| [`TypeInfo`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/typeinfo) | The TypeInfo represents a type referenced from Element or Attr nodes, specified in the schemas associated with the document. |
