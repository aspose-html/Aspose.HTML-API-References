## IDOMImplementation class

The DOMImplementation interface provides a number of methods for performing operations that are independent of any particular instance of the document object model.



The IDOMImplementation type exposes the following members:

### Methods
| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [has_feature](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/idomimplementation/has_feature/#) | Test if the DOM implementation implements a specific feature and version, as specified in DOM Features. |
| [create_document_type](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/idomimplementation/create_document_type/#str-str-str) | Creates an empty DocumentType node. Entity declarations and notations are not made available. Entity reference expansions and default attribute additions do not occur. |
| [create_document](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/idomimplementation/create_document/#str-str-aspose.html.dom.DocumentType) | Creates a DOM Document object of the specified type with its document element. |
| [create_html_document](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/idomimplementation/create_html_document/#str) | Returns a document, with a basic tree already constructed including a title element, unless the title argument is omitted. |
