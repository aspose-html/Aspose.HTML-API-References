### Methods
| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [add_event_listener](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmlfieldsetelement/add_event_listener/#str-aspose.html.dom.events.IEventListener) | This method allows the registration of event listeners on the event target. |
| [add_event_listener](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmlfieldsetelement/add_event_listener/#str-aspose.html.dom.events.IEventListener-bool) | This method allows the registration of event listeners on the event target. |
| [remove_event_listener](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmlfieldsetelement/remove_event_listener/#str-aspose.html.dom.events.IEventListener) | This method allows the removal of event listeners from the event target.<br/>If an [`IEventListener`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.events/ieventlistener) is removed from an [`EventTarget`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/eventtarget) while it is processing an event, it will not be triggered by the current actions.<br/>Event Listeners can never be invoked after being removed. |
| [remove_event_listener](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmlfieldsetelement/remove_event_listener/#str-aspose.html.dom.events.IEventListener-bool) | This method allows the removal of event listeners from the event target.<br/>If an [`IEventListener`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.events/ieventlistener) is removed from an [`EventTarget`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/eventtarget) while it is processing an event, it will not be triggered by the current actions.<br/>Event Listeners can never be invoked after being removed. |
| [clone_node](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmlfieldsetelement/clone_node/#) | Returns a duplicate of this node, i.e., serves as a generic copy constructor for nodes. The duplicate node has no parent (parentNode is null) and no user data. |
| [clone_node](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmlfieldsetelement/clone_node/#bool) | Returns a duplicate of this node, i.e., serves as a generic copy constructor for nodes. The duplicate node has no parent (parentNode is null) and no user data. |
| [toggle_attribute](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmlfieldsetelement/toggle_attribute/#str) | If force is not given, "toggles" qualifiedName, removing it if it is present and adding it if it is not present. If force is true, adds qualifiedName.<br/>If force is false, removes qualifiedName. |
| [toggle_attribute](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmlfieldsetelement/toggle_attribute/#str-bool) | If force is not given, "toggles" qualifiedName, removing it if it is present and adding it if it is not present. If force is true, adds qualifiedName.<br/>If force is false, removes qualifiedName. |
| [get_platform_type](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmlfieldsetelement/get_platform_type/#) | This method is used to retrieve ECMAScript object Type. |
| [dispatch_event](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmlfieldsetelement/dispatch_event/#aspose.html.dom.events.Event) | This method allows the dispatch of events into the implementations event model. |
| [has_child_nodes](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmlfieldsetelement/has_child_nodes/#) | Returns whether this node has any children. |
| [normalize](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmlfieldsetelement/normalize/#) | Puts all Text nodes in the full depth of the sub-tree underneath this Node, including attribute nodes, into a "normal" form where only structure (e.g., elements, comments, processing instructions, CDATA sections, and entity references) separates Text nodes, i.e., there are neither adjacent Text nodes nor empty Text nodes. This can be used to ensure that the DOM view of a document is the same as if it were saved and re-loaded, and is useful when operations (such as XPointer [XPointer] lookups) that depend on a particular document tree structure are to be used. If the parameter "normalize-characters" of the DOMConfiguration object attached to the Node.ownerDocument is true, this method will also fully normalize the characters of the Text nodes. |
| [is_equal_node](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmlfieldsetelement/is_equal_node/#aspose.html.dom.Node) | Tests whether two nodes are equal.<br/>This method tests for equality of nodes, not sameness (i.e., whether the two nodes are references to the same object) which can be tested with Node.isSameNode(). All nodes that are the same will also be equal, though the reverse may not be true. |
| [is_same_node](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmlfieldsetelement/is_same_node/#aspose.html.dom.Node) | Returns whether this node is the same node as the given one. <br/>This method provides a way to determine whether two Node references returned by the implementation reference the same object. When two Node references are references to the same object, even if through a proxy, the references may be used completely interchangeably, such that all attributes have the same values and calling the same DOM method on either reference always has exactly the same effect. |
| [lookup_prefix](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmlfieldsetelement/lookup_prefix/#str) | Look up the prefix associated to the given namespace URI, starting from this node. The default namespace declarations are ignored by this method. <br/>See Namespace Prefix Lookup for details on the algorithm used by this method. |
| [lookup_namespace_uri](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmlfieldsetelement/lookup_namespace_uri/#str) | Look up the namespace URI associated to the given prefix, starting from this node. |
| [is_default_namespace](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmlfieldsetelement/is_default_namespace/#str) | This method checks if the specified namespaceURI is the default namespace or not. |
| [insert_before](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmlfieldsetelement/insert_before/#aspose.html.dom.Node-aspose.html.dom.Node) | Inserts the node before the existing child node child. If child is null, insert node at the end of the list of children.<br/>If child is a DocumentFragment object, all of its children are inserted, in the same order, before child. If the child is already in the tree, it is first removed. |
| [replace_child](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmlfieldsetelement/replace_child/#aspose.html.dom.Node-aspose.html.dom.Node) | Replaces the child node oldChild with newChild in the list of children, and returns the oldChild node. <br/>If newChild is a DocumentFragment object, oldChild is replaced by all of the DocumentFragment children, which are inserted in the same order. If the newChild is already in the tree, it is first removed. |
| [remove_child](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmlfieldsetelement/remove_child/#aspose.html.dom.Node) | Removes the child node indicated by oldChild from the list of children, and returns it. |
| [append_child](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmlfieldsetelement/append_child/#aspose.html.dom.Node) | Adds the node newChild to the end of the list of children of this node. If the newChild is already in the tree, it is first removed. |
| [get_attribute_names](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmlfieldsetelement/get_attribute_names/#) | Returns the attribute names of the element as an Array of strings. If the element has no attributes it returns an empty array. |
| [has_attributes](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmlfieldsetelement/has_attributes/#) | Returns whether this node (if it is an element) has any attributes |
| [get_attribute](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmlfieldsetelement/get_attribute/#str) | Retrieves an attribute value by name. |
| [get_attribute_ns](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmlfieldsetelement/get_attribute_ns/#str-str) | Retrieves an attribute value by local name and namespace URI. |
| [set_attribute](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmlfieldsetelement/set_attribute/#str-str) | Adds a new attribute. If an attribute with that name is already present in the element, its value is changed to be that of the value parameter |
| [set_attribute_ns](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmlfieldsetelement/set_attribute_ns/#str-str-str) | Adds a new attribute. If an attribute with the same local name and namespace URI is already present on the element, its prefix is changed to be the prefix part of the qualifiedName, and its value is changed to be the value parameter. |
| [remove_attribute](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmlfieldsetelement/remove_attribute/#str) | Removes an attribute by name. |
| [remove_attribute_ns](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmlfieldsetelement/remove_attribute_ns/#str-str) | Removes an attribute by local name and namespace URI. |
| [has_attribute](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmlfieldsetelement/has_attribute/#str) | Returns true when an attribute with a given name is specified on this element or has a default value, false otherwise. |
| [has_attribute_ns](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmlfieldsetelement/has_attribute_ns/#str-str) | Returns true when an attribute with a given local name and namespace URI is specified on this element or has a default value, false otherwise. |
