## files property


The files IDL attribute allows scripts to access the element’s selected files.
On getting, if the IDL attribute applies, it must return a FileList object that represents the current selected files. 
The same object must be returned until the list of selected files changes. If the IDL attribute does not apply, then it must instead return null.  [FILEAPI]
