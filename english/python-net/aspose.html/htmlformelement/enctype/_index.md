## enctype property


The content type of the submitted form, generally 
"application/x-www-form-urlencoded". See the enctype attribute 
definition in HTML 4.01. The onsubmit even handler is not guaranteed 
to be triggered when invoking this method. The behavior is 
inconsistent for historical reasons and authors should not rely on a 
particular one.
### Definition:
```python
@property
def enctype(self):
    ...
@enctype.setter
def enctype(self, value):
    ...
```
