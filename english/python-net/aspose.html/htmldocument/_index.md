## HTMLDocument class

An `HTMLDocument` is the root of the HTML hierarchy and holds 
the entire content. Besides providing access to the hierarchy, it also 
provides some convenience methods for accessing certain sets of 
information from the document.

The following properties have been deprecated in favor of the 
corresponding ones for the `BODY` element.
In DOM Level 2, the method `getElementById` is inherited from the `Document` 
interface where it was moved to.



See also the [Document object Model (DOM) Level 2 HTML Specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-DOM-Level-2-HTML-20030109).



**Inheritance:** [`HTMLDocument`](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument) → 
[`Document`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/document) → 
[`Node`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/node) → 
[`EventTarget`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/eventtarget) → 
[`DOMObject`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/domobject)



The HTMLDocument type exposes the following members:

| [strict_error_checking](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/strict_error_checking) | An attribute specifying whether error checking is enforced or not. When set to false, the implementation is free to not test every possible error case normally defined on DOM operations, and not raise any DOMException on DOM operations or report errors while using Document.normalizeDocument().

| [domain](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/domain) | The domain name of the server that served the document, or <br/>`null` if the server cannot be identified by a domain <br/>name. |
| [body](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/body) | The element that contains the content for the document. In documents <br/>with `BODY` contents, returns the `BODY` <br/>element. In frameset documents, this returns the outermost <br/>`FRAMESET` element. |
| [images](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/images) | A collection of all the `IMG` elements in a document. The <br/>behavior is limited to `IMG` elements for backwards <br/>compatibility. As suggested by [[HTML 4.01](http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224)], to include images, authors may use <br/>the `OBJECT` element or the `IMG` element. <br/>Therefore, it is recommended not to use this attribute to find the <br/>images in the document but `getElementsByTagName` with <br/>HTML 4.01 or `getElementsByTagNameNS` with XHTML 1.0. |
| [applets](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/applets) | A collection of all the `OBJECT` elements that include <br/>applets and `APPLET` (deprecated) elements in a document. |
| [links](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/links) | A collection of all `AREA` elements and anchor (<br/>`A`) elements in a document with a value for the <br/>`href` attribute. |
| [forms](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/forms) | A collection of all the forms of a document. |
| [anchors](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/anchors) | A collection of all the anchor (`A`) elements in a document <br/>with a value for the `name` attribute. For reasons of <br/>backward compatibility, the returned set of anchors only contains <br/>those anchors created with the `name` attribute, not those <br/>created with the `id` attribute. Note that in [[XHTML 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/REC-xhtml1-20020801)], the <br/>`name` attribute (see section 4.10) has no semantics and <br/>is only present for legacy user agents: the `id` attribute <br/>is used instead. Users should prefer the iterator mechanisms provided <br/>by [[DOM Level 2 Traversal](http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-DOM-Level-2-Traversal-Range-20001113)] instead. |

| [get_platform_type](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/get_platform_type/#) | This method is used to retrieve the ECMAScript object Type. |
| [dispatch_event](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/dispatch_event/#aspose.html.dom.events.Event) | Dispatches an Event at the specified [`IEventTarget`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.events/ieventtarget), (synchronously) invoking<br/>the affected EventListeners in the appropriate order. <br/>The normal event processing rules (including the capturing and optional bubbling phase) also apply to events <br/>dispatched manually with [`IEventTarget.dispatch_event`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.events/ieventtarget/dispatch_event). |
| [has_child_nodes](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/has_child_nodes/#) | Returns a boolean value indicating whether the given [`Node`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/node) has child nodes or not. |
| [normalize](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/normalize/#) | Puts all Text nodes in the full depth of the sub-tree underneath this Node, including attribute nodes, into a "normal" form where only structure (e.g., elements, comments, processing instructions, CDATA sections, and entity references) separates Text nodes, i.e., there are neither adjacent Text nodes nor empty Text nodes. This can be used to ensure that the DOM view of a document is the same as if it were saved and re-loaded, and is useful when operations (such as XPointer [XPointer] lookups) that depend on a particular document tree structure are to be used. If the parameter "normalize-characters" of the DOMConfiguration object attached to the Node.ownerDocument is true, this method will also fully normalize the characters of the Text nodes. |
| [is_equal_node](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/is_equal_node/#aspose.html.dom.Node) | Tests whether two nodes are equal.<br/>This method tests for equality of nodes, not sameness (i.e., whether the two nodes are references to the same object) which can be tested with Node.isSameNode(). All nodes that are the same will also be equal, though the reverse may not be true. |
| [is_same_node](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/is_same_node/#aspose.html.dom.Node) | Method is a legacy alias the for the  strict equality operator. That is, it tests whether two nodes are the same (in other words, whether they reference the same object). |
| [lookup_prefix](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/lookup_prefix/#str) | Look up the prefix associated to the given namespace URI, starting from this node. The default namespace declarations are ignored by this method. <br/>See Namespace Prefix Lookup for details on the algorithm used by this method. |
| [lookup_namespace_uri](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/lookup_namespace_uri/#str) | Look up the namespace URI associated to the given prefix, starting from this node. |
| [is_default_namespace](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/is_default_namespace/#str) | This method checks if the specified namespaceURI is the default namespace or not. |
| [insert_before](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/insert_before/#aspose.html.dom.Node-aspose.html.dom.Node) | Inserts the node before the existing child node child. If child is null, insert node at the end of the list of children.<br/>If child is a DocumentFragment object, all of its children are inserted, in the same order, before child. If the child is already in the tree, it is first removed. |
| [replace_child](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/replace_child/#aspose.html.dom.Node-aspose.html.dom.Node) | Replaces the child node oldChild with newChild in the list of children, and returns the oldChild node. <br/>If newChild is a DocumentFragment object, oldChild is replaced by all of the DocumentFragment children, which are inserted in the same order. If the newChild is already in the tree, it is first removed. |
| [remove_child](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/remove_child/#aspose.html.dom.Node) | Removes a child node from the DOM and returns the removed node. |
| [append_child](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/append_child/#aspose.html.dom.Node) | Adds a node to the end of the list of children of a specified parent node. If the given child is a reference to an existing node in the document, [`Node.append_child`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/node/append_child) moves it from its current position to the new position (there is no requirement to remove the node from its parent node before appending it to some other node).<br/><br/><br/>This means that a node can't be in two points of the document simultaneously. So if the node already has a parent, the node is first removed, then appended at the new position. The [`Node.clone_node`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/node/clone_node) method can be used to make a copy of the node before appending it under the new parent. Copies made with [`Node.clone_node`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/node/clone_node) are not be automatically kept in sync. |
| [create_element](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/create_element/#str) | Creates the HTML element specified by , or an  if localName isn't recognized. |
| [create_element_ns](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/create_element_ns/#str-str) | Creates an element of the given qualified name and namespace URI. |
| [create_document_fragment](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/create_document_fragment/#) | Creates a new empty [`DocumentFragment`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/documentfragment) into which DOM nodes can be added to build an offscreen DOM tree. |

| [create_comment](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/create_comment/#str) | Creates a Comment node given the specified string. |
| [create_cdata_section](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/create_cdata_section/#str) | Creates a CDATASection node whose value is the specified string. |
| [create_processing_instruction](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/create_processing_instruction/#str-str) | Creates a ProcessingInstruction node given the specified name and data strings. |
| [create_attribute](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/create_attribute/#str) | This method creates a new attribute node, and returns it. <br/>The object created is a node implementing the [`Attr`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/attr) class. <br/>The DOM does not enforce what sort of attributes can be added to a particular element in this manner. |
| [create_attribute_ns](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/create_attribute_ns/#str-str) | This method creates a new attribute node, and returns it. <br/>The object created is a node implementing the [`Attr`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/attr) class. <br/>The DOM does not enforce what sort of attributes can be added to a particular element in this manner. |
| [create_entity_reference](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/create_entity_reference/#str) | Creates an EntityReference object. In addition, if the referenced entity is known, the child list of the EntityReference node is made the same as that of the corresponding Entity node. |
| [create_document_type](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/create_document_type/#str-str-str-str) | The method returns a [`DocumentType`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/documenttype) object which can either be used <br/>with [`IDOMImplementation.create_document`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/idomimplementation/create_document) upon document creation or can be put into the document via methods <br/>like [`Node.insert_before`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/node/insert_before) or [`Node.replace_child`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/node/replace_child). |
| [get_elements_by_tag_name](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/get_elements_by_tag_name/#str) | This method returns an [`HTMLCollection`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.collections/htmlcollection) of elements with the given tag name.<br/><br/><br/>The complete document is searched, including the root node. <br/>The returned [`HTMLCollection`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.collections/htmlcollection) is live,<br/>meaning that it updates itself automatically to stay in sync with the DOM tree without having to call <br/>this method again. |
| [get_elements_by_tag_name_ns](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/get_elements_by_tag_name_ns/#str-str) | Returns a list of elements with the given tag name belonging to the given namespace.<br/>The complete document is searched, including the root node. |
| [get_element_by_id](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/get_element_by_id/#str) | This method returns an [`Element`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/element) object representing the element whose id property matches the specified string. Since element IDs are required to be unique if specified, they're a useful way to get access to a specific element quickly.<br/><br/><br/>If you need to get access to an element which doesn't have an ID, you can use [`Document.query_selector`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/document/query_selector) to find the element using any selector. |
| [get_elements_by_class_name](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/get_elements_by_class_name/#str) | This method returns an array-like object of all child elements which have all the given class name(s).<br/><br/><br/>When called on the document object, the complete document is searched, including the root node. <br/>You may also call this method on any element; it will return only elements which are descendants <br/>of the specified root element with the given class name(s). |
| [query_selector_all](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/query_selector_all/#str) | Returns a NodeList of all the Elements in document, which match selector |
| [query_selector](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/query_selector/#str) | Returns the first Element in document, which match selector |
| [import_node](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/import_node/#aspose.html.dom.Node-bool) | Imports a node from another document to this document, without altering or removing the source node from the original document; this method creates a new copy of the source node. |
| [create_event](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/create_event/#str) | Creates an [`Event`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.events/event) of a type supported by the implementation. |
| [write](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/write/#list) | Write a string of text to a document stream opened by<br/>open(). Note that the function will produce a document<br/>which is not necessarily driven by a DTD and therefore might be<br/>produce an invalid result in the context of the document. |
| [write_ln](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/write_ln/#list) | Write a string of text followed by a newline character to a document<br/>stream opened by open(). Note that the function will<br/>produce a document which is not necessarily driven by a DTD and<br/>therefore might be produce an invalid result in the context of the<br/>document |
| [create_expression](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/create_expression/#str-aspose.html.dom.xpath.IXPathNSResolver) | Creates a parsed XPath expression with resolved namespaces. This is useful <br/>when an expression will be reused in an application since it makes it possible <br/>to compile the expression string into a more efficient internal form and <br/>preresolve all namespace prefixes which occur within the expression. |
| [create_ns_resolver](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/create_ns_resolver/#aspose.html.dom.Node) | Adapts any DOM node to resolve namespaces so that an XPath expression can be easily evaluated<br/>relative to the context of the node where it appeared within the document. This adapter works<br/>like the DOM Level 3 method `lookupNamespaceURI` on nodes in resolving the namespaceURI<br/>from a given prefix using the current information available in the node's hierarchy at the time<br/>lookupNamespaceURI is called, also correctly resolving the implicit xml prefix. |
| [evaluate](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/evaluate/#str-aspose.html.dom.Node-aspose.html.dom.xpath.IXPathNSResolver-aspose.html.dom.xpath.XPathResultType-any) | Evaluates an XPath expression string and returns a result of the specified type if possible. |
| [render_to](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmldocument/render_to/#aspose.html.rendering.IDevice) | This method is used to print the contents of the current document to the specified device. |
