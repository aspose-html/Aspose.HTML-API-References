## IHTMLOptionsCollection class

An `HTMLOptionsCollection` is a list of nodes representing HTML 
option element. An individual node may be accessed by either ordinal 
index or the node's `name` or `id` attributes.  
Collections in the HTML DOM are assumed to be live meaning that they are 
automatically updated when the underlying document is changed. 

See also the [Document object Model (DOM) Level 2 HTML Specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-DOM-Level-2-HTML-20030109).
