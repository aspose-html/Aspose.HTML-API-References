## prevent_default {#}

If an event is cancelable, the [`Event.prevent_default`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.events/event/prevent_default) method is used to signify that the event is to be canceled,
meaning any default action normally taken by the implementation as a result of the event will not occur.



```python
def prevent_default(self):
    ...
```


### Remarks

If, during any stage of event flow, the [`Event.prevent_default`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.events/event/prevent_default) method is called the event is canceled.
Any default action associated with the event will not occur.
Calling this method for a non-cancelable event has no effect.
Once [`Event.prevent_default`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.events/event/prevent_default) has been called it will remain in effect throughout the remainder of the event's propagation.
This method may be used during any stage of event flow.
