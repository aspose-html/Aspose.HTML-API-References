## code property


The code holds a string that identifies the physical key being pressed. The value is not affected by the current keyboard layout or modifier state, so a particular key will always return the same value.
### Definition:
```python
@property
def code(self):
    ...
@code.setter
def code(self, value):
    ...
```
