## DOM_KEY_LOCATION_NUMPAD property


The key activation originated on the numeric keypad or with a virtual key corresponding to the numeric keypad (when there is more than one possible location for this key). Note that the NumLock key should always be encoded with a location of DOM_KEY_LOCATION_STANDARD.
