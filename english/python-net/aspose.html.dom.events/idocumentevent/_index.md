## IDocumentEvent class

The [`IDocumentEvent`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.events/idocumentevent) interface provides a mechanism by which the user can create an [`Event`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.events/event) of a type supported by the implementation.



The IDocumentEvent type exposes the following members:

### Methods
| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [create_event](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.events/idocumentevent/create_event/#str) | Creates an [`Event`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.events/event) of a type supported by the implementation. |



### Remarks 


It is expected that the [`IDocumentEvent`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.events/idocumentevent) interface will be implemented on the same object which implements the
[`Document`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/document)
interface in an implementation which supports the Event model.
