## move_to {#aspose.pydrawing.PointF}

Begins a new subpath by moving the current point to coordinates of the parameter pt, omitting any connecting line segment. 
If the previous path construction method in the current path was also "MoveTo", the new "MoveTo" overrides it; 
no vestige of the previous "MoveTo" operation remains in the path.



```python
def move_to(self, pt):
    ...
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :- | :- | :- |
