## adjust_to_widest_page property


Gets or sets flag that determines case when page size will be adjusted to widest page in document.
This options is time-consuming so time of document processing can be increased in two times. Adjustment will
take place only if widest page in document is wider than page size determined in [`PageSetup`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.rendering/pagesetup). Adjusted
page size will be used for all pages in document.
