| :- | :- | :- |
| image | [`HTMLImageElement`](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmlimageelement) | The HTMLImageElement to draw into the context. |
| dx | float | The X coordinate in the destination canvas at which to place the top-left corner of the source image. |
| dy | float | The Y coordinate in the destination canvas at which to place the top-left corner of the source image. |


## draw_image {#aspose.html.HTMLCanvasElement-float-float}

Draws the specified image.



```python
def draw_image(self, image, dx, dy):
    ...
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :- | :- | :- |
| image | [`HTMLCanvasElement`](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmlcanvaselement) | The HTMLCanvasElement to draw into the context. |
| dx | float | The X coordinate in the destination canvas at which to place the top-left corner of the source image. |

Draws the specified image.



```python
def draw_image(self, image, dx, dy, dw, dh):
    ...
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :- | :- | :- |
| image | [`HTMLImageElement`](/html/python-net/aspose.html/htmlimageelement) | The HTMLImageElement to draw into the context. |
| dx | float | The X coordinate in the destination canvas at which to place the top-left corner of the source image. |
| dy | float | The Y coordinate in the destination canvas at which to place the top-left corner of the source image. |
| dw | float | The width to draw the image in the destination canvas. This allows scaling of the drawn image. If not specified, the image is not scaled in width when drawn. |
| dh | float | The height to draw the image in the destination canvas. This allows scaling of the drawn image. If not specified, the image is not scaled in height when drawn. |
