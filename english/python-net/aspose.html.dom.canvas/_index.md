The **Aspose.Html.Dom.Canvas**  namespace provides interfaces
for 2D rendering details qualification as well as options for
filling and Path2D class.

### Classes
| Class | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`ICanvasDrawingStyles`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.canvas/icanvasdrawingstyles) | The ICanvasDrawingStyles interface provides methods and properties control how lines are drawn and how text is laid out. |
| [`ICanvasGradient`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.canvas/icanvasgradient) | Represents an opaque object describing a gradient. |
| [`ICanvasPathMethods`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.canvas/icanvaspathmethods) | The ICanvasPathMethods interface is used to manipulate paths of objects. |
| [`ICanvasPattern`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.canvas/icanvaspattern) | Represents an opaque object describing a pattern, based on an image, a canvas or a video. |
| [`ICanvasRenderingContext2D`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.canvas/icanvasrenderingcontext2d) | The ICanvasRenderingContext2D interface is used for drawing rectangles, text, images and other objects onto the canvas element. It provides the 2D rendering context for the drawing surface of a canvas element. |
| [`IImageData`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.canvas/iimagedata) | Creates an ImageData object from a given Uint8ClampedArray and the size of the image it contains. <br/>If no array is given, it creates an image of a black rectangle. |
| [`ITextMetrics`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.canvas/itextmetrics) | Represents the dimension of a text in the canvas. |
| [`Path2D`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.canvas/path2d) | The Path2D interface of the Canvas 2D API is used to declare paths that are then later used on CanvasRenderingContext2D objects. <br/>The path methods of the CanvasRenderingContext2D interface are present on this interface as well and are allowing you to create <br/>paths that you can retain and replay as required on a canvas. |


### Enumerations
| Enumeration | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`CanvasFillRule`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.canvas/canvasfillrule) | This enumeration is used to select the fill rule algorithm by which to determine if a point is inside or outside a path. |
