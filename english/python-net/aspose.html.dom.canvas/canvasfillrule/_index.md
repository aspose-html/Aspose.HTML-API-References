## CanvasFillRule enumeration

This enumeration is used to select the fill rule algorithm by which to determine if a point is inside or outside a path.



The CanvasFillRule type exposes the following members:

### Fields
| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| NON_ZERO | The value "nonzero" value indicates the non-zero winding rule, wherein a point is considered to be outside a <br/>shape if the number of times a half-infinite straight line drawn from that point crosses the shape's path <br/>going in one direction is equal to the number of times it crosses the path going in the other direction. |
| EVEN_ODD | The "evenodd" value indicates the even-odd rule, wherein a point is considered to be outside a shape if the <br/>number of times a half-infinite straight line drawn from that point crosses the shape's path is even. |
