## LengthOrAuto class

Represents a container for storage length or 'auto' units..



**Inheritance:** [`LengthOrAuto`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/lengthorauto) → 
[`Unit`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/unit)



The LengthOrAuto type exposes the following members:

### Constructors
| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [__init__](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/lengthorauto/__init__/#) | Initializes a new instance of the [`LengthOrAuto`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/lengthorauto) class and sets state to 'auto'. |
