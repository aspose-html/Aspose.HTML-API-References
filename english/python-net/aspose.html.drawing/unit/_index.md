## Unit class

Provides the base class for units of measurement.



The Unit type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [unit_type](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/unit/unit_type) | Gets the unit type of the [`Unit`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/unit). |


### Methods
| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [equals](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/unit/equals/#aspose.html.drawing.Unit) | Determines whether the specified [`Unit`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/unit), is equal to this instance. |
