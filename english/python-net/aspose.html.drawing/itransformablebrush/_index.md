Desclares methods for getting transformation matrix and wrap mode.



The ITransformableBrush type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [transformation_matrix](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/itransformablebrush/transformation_matrix) | Get the transform. The transform defines a local geometric transform for this brush. |
| [spread_mode](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/itransformablebrush/spread_mode) | Gets or sets the SpreadMode mode. SpreadMode mode specifies how a texture or gradient is tiled<br/>when it is smaller than the area being filled. |
| [type](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/itransformablebrush/type) | Gets type of brush as [`BrushType`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/brushtype). |
