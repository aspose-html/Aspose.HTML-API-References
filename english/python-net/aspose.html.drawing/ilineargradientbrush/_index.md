## ILinearGradientBrush class

Defines an interface for a brush with a linear gradient.



The ILinearGradientBrush type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [rect](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/ilineargradientbrush/rect) | Gets or sets the rectangular region that defines the starting and ending points of the gradient. |
| [angle](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/ilineargradientbrush/angle) | Gets or sets the angle, measured in degrees clockwise from the x-axis, of the gradient's orientation line. |
| [interpolation_colors](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/ilineargradientbrush/interpolation_colors) | Gets or sets the interpolation colors that defines a multicolor linear gradient. |
| [blend_positions](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/ilineargradientbrush/blend_positions) | Gets or sets the blend positions that define a custom falloff for the gradient. |
| [blend_factors](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/ilineargradientbrush/blend_factors) | Gets or sets the blend factors that define a custom falloff for the gradient. |
| [transformation_matrix](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/ilineargradientbrush/transformation_matrix) | Get the transform. The transform defines a local geometric transform for this brush. |
| [spread_mode](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/ilineargradientbrush/spread_mode) | Gets or sets the SpreadMode mode. SpreadMode mode specifies how a texture or gradient is tiled<br/>when it is smaller than the area being filled. |
| [type](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/ilineargradientbrush/type) | Gets type of brush as [`BrushType`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/brushtype). |
