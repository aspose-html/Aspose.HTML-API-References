The **Aspose.Html.Drawing**  namespace contains objects and
interfaces to specify measurement and units as well as
drawing attribute objects like brushes, colors and fonts.

### Classes
| Class | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`Angle`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/angle) | The angle data type |
| [`Color`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/color) | The Color class lets you specify colors as <br/>Red-Green-Blue (RGB) values,<br/>Hue-Saturation-Luminosity (HSL) values,<br/>Hue-Saturation-Value (HSV) values,<br/>Hue-Whiteness-Blackness (HWB) values,<br/>lightness-A-B (LAB) values,<br/>Luminance-Chroma-Hue (LCH) values,<br/>Cyan-Magenta-Yellow-Key (CMYK) values,<br/>Natural colors (NCOL) values,<br/>or with a color name. <br/>An Alpha channel is also available to indicate transparency. |
