## Numeric class

Provides the base class for numeric types.



**Inheritance:** [`Numeric`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/numeric) → 
[`Unit`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/unit)



The Numeric type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [unit_type](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/numeric/unit_type) | Gets the unit type of the [`Unit`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/unit). |


### Methods
| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [get_value](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/numeric/get_value/#) | Gets the unit value. |
| [get_value](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/numeric/get_value/#aspose.html.drawing.UnitType) | Gets the value converted to the specified [`UnitType`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/unittype). |
| [equals](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/numeric/equals/#aspose.html.drawing.Unit) | Determines whether the specified [`Unit`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/unit), is equal to this instance. |

| [from_gradians](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/numeric/from_gradians/#float) | Returns a [`Angle`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/angle) object that is represented in gradians. |
| [from_radians](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/numeric/from_radians/#float) | Returns a [`Angle`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/angle) object that is represented in radians. |
| [from_turns](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/numeric/from_turns/#float) | Returns a [`Angle`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/angle) object that is represented in turns. |
| [from_seconds](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/numeric/from_seconds/#float) | Returns a [`Time`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/time) object that is represented in seconds. |
| [from_milliseconds](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/numeric/from_milliseconds/#float) | Returns a [`Time`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/time) object that is represented in milliseconds. |
| [from_hertz](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/numeric/from_hertz/#float) | Returns a [`Frequency`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/frequency) object that is represented in hertz. |
| [from_kilo_hertz](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/numeric/from_kilo_hertz/#float) | Returns a [`Frequency`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/frequency) object that is represented in kiloHertz. |
| [from_dots_per_inch](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/numeric/from_dots_per_inch/#float) | Returns a [`Resolution`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/resolution) object that is represented in dots per inch. |
| [from_dots_per_centimeters](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/numeric/from_dots_per_centimeters/#float) | Returns a [`Resolution`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/resolution) object that is represented in dots per centimeters. |
| [from_dots_per_pixel](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/numeric/from_dots_per_pixel/#float) | Returns a [`Resolution`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/resolution) object that is represented in dots per pixels. |
| [compare_to](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/numeric/compare_to/#aspose.html.drawing.Numeric) | Compares the current instance with another object of the same type and returns an integer that indicates whether the current instance precedes, follows, or occurs in the same position in the sort order as the other object. |
