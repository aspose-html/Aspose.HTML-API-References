## sub_family_name property


The Font Subfamily name distinguishes the font in a group with the same Font Family name. 
This is assumed to address style (italic, oblique) and weight (light, bold, black, etc.). 
A font with no particular differences in weight or style (e.g. medium weight, not italic and fsSelection bit 6 set) should have the string "Regular" stored in this position.
### Definition:
