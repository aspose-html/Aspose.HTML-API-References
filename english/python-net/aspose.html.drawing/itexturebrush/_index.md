| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [image](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/itexturebrush/image) | Gets or sets the image used by the brush. |
| [opacity](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/itexturebrush/opacity) | Get opacity value in a color transform matrix. |
| [image_area](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/itexturebrush/image_area) | Specifies the portion of the image used by the brush.<br/>If it equals RectangleF.Empty then the whole image will be used.<br/>Coordinates are in pixels. |
| [color_map](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/itexturebrush/color_map) | The number of elements must be even. Every even element is old color. Every odd element is new color. |
| [transformation_matrix](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/itexturebrush/transformation_matrix) | Get the transform. The transform defines a local geometric transform for this brush. |
| [wrap_mode](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/itexturebrush/wrap_mode) | Gets or sets the wrap mode. Wrap mode specifies how a texture or gradient is tiled<br/>when it is smaller than the area being filled. |
| [type](/html/python-net/aspose.html.drawing/itexturebrush/type) | Get type of brush; |
