## Criterion class

Verifiable success criteria are provided for each recommendation, so WCAG 2.0 can be applied in areas where compliance testing is required.

**Inheritance:** [`Criterion`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.accessibility/criterion) → 
[`Rule`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.accessibility/rule)



The Criterion type exposes the following members:

### Properties
