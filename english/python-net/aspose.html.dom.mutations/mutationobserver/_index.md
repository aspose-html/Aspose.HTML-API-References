## MutationObserver class

A [`MutationObserver`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.mutations/mutationobserver) object can be used to observe mutations to the tree of [`Node`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/node).



**Inheritance:** [`MutationObserver`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.mutations/mutationobserver) → 
[`DOMObject`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/domobject)



The MutationObserver type exposes the following members:

### Methods
| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [observe](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.mutations/mutationobserver/observe/#aspose.html.dom.Node) | Instructs the user agent to observe a given target (a node) and report any mutations based on the criteria given by options (an object).<br/>The options argument allows for setting mutation observation options via object members. |
| [observe](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.mutations/mutationobserver/observe/#aspose.html.dom.Node-aspose.html.dom.mutations.MutationObserverInit) | Instructs the user agent to observe a given target (a node) and report any mutations based on the criteria given by options (an object).<br/>The options argument allows for setting mutation observation options via object members. |
| [get_platform_type](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.mutations/mutationobserver/get_platform_type/#) | This method is used to retrieve ECMAScript object Type. |
| [disconnect](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.mutations/mutationobserver/disconnect/#) | Stops observer from observing any mutations. Until the observe() method is used again, observer’s callback will not be invoked. |
| [take_records](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.mutations/mutationobserver/take_records/#) | The method returns a copy of the record queue and then empty the record queue. |
