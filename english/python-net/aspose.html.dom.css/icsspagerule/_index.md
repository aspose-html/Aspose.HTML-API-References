## ICSSPageRule class

The CSSPageRule interface represents a @page rule within a CSS style sheet. The @page rule is used to specify the dimensions, orientation, margins, etc. of a page box for paged media.



The ICSSPageRule type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [selector_text](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.css/icsspagerule/selector_text) | The parsable textual representation of the page selector for the rule. |
| [style](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.css/icsspagerule/style) | The declaration-block of this rule. |
| [type](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.css/icsspagerule/type) | The type of the rule, as defined above. The expectation is that binding-specific casting methods can be used to cast down from an instance of the CSSRule interface to the specific derived interface implied by the type. |
| [css_text](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.css/icsspagerule/css_text) | The parsable textual representation of the rule. This reflects the current state of the rule and not its initial value. |
| [parent_style_sheet](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.css/icsspagerule/parent_style_sheet) | The style sheet that contains this rule. |
| [parent_rule](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.css/icsspagerule/parent_rule) | If this rule is contained inside another rule (e.g. a style rule inside an @media block), this is the containing rule. If this rule is not nested inside any other rules, this returns null. |
