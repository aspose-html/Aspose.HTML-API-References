## ICSSKeyframeRule class

The CSSKeyframeRule interface represents the style rule for a single key.



The ICSSKeyframeRule type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [key_text](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.css/icsskeyframerule/key_text) | This attribute represents the keyframe selector as a comma-separated list of percentage values. The ‘from’ and ‘to’ keywords map to ‘0%’ and ‘100%’, respectively. |
| [style](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.css/icsskeyframerule/style) | This attribute represents the style associated with this keyframe. |
| [type](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.css/icsskeyframerule/type) | The type of the rule, as defined above. The expectation is that binding-specific casting methods can be used to cast down from an instance of the CSSRule interface to the specific derived interface implied by the type. |
| [css_text](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.css/icsskeyframerule/css_text) | The parsable textual representation of the rule. This reflects the current state of the rule and not its initial value. |
| [parent_style_sheet](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.css/icsskeyframerule/parent_style_sheet) | The style sheet that contains this rule. |
| [parent_rule](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.css/icsskeyframerule/parent_rule) | If this rule is contained inside another rule (e.g. a style rule inside an @media block), this is the containing rule. If this rule is not nested inside any other rules, this returns null. |
