## ICSSCounterStyleRule class

The @counter-style rule allows authors to define a custom counter style.



The ICSSCounterStyleRule type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [name](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.css/icsscounterstylerule/name) | Gets the name. |
| [counter_type](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.css/icsscounterstylerule/counter_type) | Gets the type of the counter. |
| [glyphs](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.css/icsscounterstylerule/glyphs) | Gets the glyphs. |
| [prefix](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.css/icsscounterstylerule/prefix) | Gets the prefix. |
| [suffix](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.css/icsscounterstylerule/suffix) | Gets the suffix. |
| [fallback](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.css/icsscounterstylerule/fallback) | Gets the fallback. |
| [type](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.css/icsscounterstylerule/type) | The type of the rule, as defined above. The expectation is that binding-specific casting methods can be used to cast down from an instance of the CSSRule interface to the specific derived interface implied by the type. |
| [css_text](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.css/icsscounterstylerule/css_text) | The parsable textual representation of the rule. This reflects the current state of the rule and not its initial value. |
| [parent_style_sheet](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.css/icsscounterstylerule/parent_style_sheet) | The style sheet that contains this rule. |
| [parent_rule](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.css/icsscounterstylerule/parent_rule) | If this rule is contained inside another rule (e.g. a style rule inside an @media block), this is the containing rule. If this rule is not nested inside any other rules, this returns null. |
