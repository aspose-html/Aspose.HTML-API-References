## RGBColor class

The RGBColor interface is used to represent any RGB color value. This interface reflects the values in the underlying style property. Hence, modifications made to the CSSPrimitiveValue objects modify the style property.



**Inheritance:** [`RGBColor`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom.css/rgbcolor) → 
[`DOMObject`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/domobject)
