## what_to_show property


This attribute determines which node types are presented via the
iterator. The available set of constants is defined in the
NodeFilter interface.  Nodes not accepted by
whatToShow will be skipped, but their children may still
be considered. Note that this skip takes precedence over the filter,
if any.
