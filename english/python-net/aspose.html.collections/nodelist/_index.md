## NodeList class

The NodeList provides the abstraction of an ordered collection of nodes, without defining or constraining how this collection is implemented.



**Inheritance:** [`NodeList`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.collections/nodelist) → 
[`DOMObject`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/domobject)



The NodeList type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [length](/html/python-net/aspose.html.collections/nodelist/length) | The number of nodes in the list. |



Method returns the indexth item in the collection. If index is greater than or equal to the number of nodes in the list, this returns null.
### Indexer
| Name | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [index] | The index. |


### Methods
