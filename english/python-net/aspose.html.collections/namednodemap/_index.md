## NamedNodeMap class

Represents collections of attributes that can be accessed by name.



**Inheritance:** [`NamedNodeMap`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.collections/namednodemap) → 
[`DOMObject`](/html/python-net/aspose.html.dom/domobject)



The NamedNodeMap type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [length](/html/python-net/aspose.html.collections/namednodemap/length) | The number of nodes in this map. |



Returns the index-th item in the map. If index is greater than or equal to the number of nodes in this map, this returns null.
### Indexer
| Name | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [index] | The index. |


### Methods
| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [get_platform_type](/html/python-net/aspose.html.collections/namednodemap/get_platform_type/#) | This method is used to retrieve ECMAScript object Type. |
| [get_named_item](/html/python-net/aspose.html.collections/namednodemap/get_named_item/#str) | Retrieves a node specified by name. |
| [get_named_item_ns](/html/python-net/aspose.html.collections/namednodemap/get_named_item_ns/#str-str) | Retrieves a node specified by local name and namespace URI. |
| [set_named_item](/html/python-net/aspose.html.collections/namednodemap/set_named_item/#aspose.html.dom.Attr) | Adds a node using its nodeName attribute. If a node with that name is already present in this map, it is replaced by the new one. Replacing a node by itself has no effect. |
| [set_named_item_ns](/html/python-net/aspose.html.collections/namednodemap/set_named_item_ns/#aspose.html.dom.Attr) | Adds a node using its namespaceURI and localName. If a node with that namespace URI and that local name is already present in this map, it is replaced by the new one. Replacing a node by itself has no effect. |
| [remove_named_item](/html/python-net/aspose.html.collections/namednodemap/remove_named_item/#str) | Removes a node specified by name. |
| [remove_named_item_ns](/html/python-net/aspose.html.collections/namednodemap/remove_named_item_ns/#str-str) | Removes a node specified by local name and namespace URI. |
