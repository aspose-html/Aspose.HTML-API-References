| override [CanRead](../../aspose.html.io/outputstream/canread) { get; } | Gets a value indicating whether the wrapped output stream supports reading. |
| override [CanSeek](../../aspose.html.io/outputstream/canseek) { get; } | Gets a value indicating whether the wrapped output stream supports seeking. |
| override [CanWrite](../../aspose.html.io/outputstream/canwrite) { get; } | Gets a value indicating whether the wrapped output stream supports writing. |
| override [Length](../../aspose.html.io/outputstream/length) { get; } | Gets the length in bytes of the wrapped output stream. |
| override [Position](../../aspose.html.io/outputstream/position) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the position within the wrapped output stream. |
