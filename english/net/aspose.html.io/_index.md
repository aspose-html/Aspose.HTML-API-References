| [ICreateStreamProvider](./icreatestreamprovider) | Represents an interface that can be implemented by classes providing streams to the rendering devices. |
| [IFile](./ifile) | A File object is a Blob object with a name attribute, which is a string; it can be created within the web application via a constructor, or is a reference to a byte sequence from a file from the underlying (OS) file system. |
