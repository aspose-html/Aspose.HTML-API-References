## EventTarget class

The [`EventTarget`](../eventtarget) interface is implemented by all Nodes in an implementation which supports the DOM Event Model. Therefore, this interface can be obtained by using binding-specific casting methods on an instance of the Node interface. The interface allows registration and removal of Event Listeners on an [`EventTarget`](../eventtarget) and dispatch of events to that [`IEventTarget`](../../aspose.html.dom.events/ieventtarget).

```csharp
public class EventTarget : DOMObject, IDisposable, IEventTarget
```

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [AddEventListener](../../aspose.html.dom/eventtarget/addeventlistener)(string, IEventListener) | This method allows the registration of event listeners on the event target. |
| [AddEventListener](../../aspose.html.dom/eventtarget/addeventlistener)(string, DOMEventHandler, bool) | This method allows the registration of event listeners on the event target. |
| [AddEventListener](../../aspose.html.dom/eventtarget/addeventlistener)(string, IEventListener, bool) | This method allows the registration of event listeners on the event target. |
| [DispatchEvent](../../aspose.html.dom/eventtarget/dispatchevent)(Event) | This method allows the dispatch of events into the implementations event model. |
| [Dispose](../../aspose.html.dom/eventtarget/dispose)() | Performs application-defined tasks associated with freeing, releasing, or resetting unmanaged resources. |
| virtual [GetPlatformType](../../aspose.html.dom/domobject/getplatformtype)() | This method is used to retrieve ECMAScript object Type. |
| [RemoveEventListener](../../aspose.html.dom/eventtarget/removeeventlistener)(string, IEventListener) | This method allows the removal of event listeners from the event target. If an [`IEventListener`](../../aspose.html.dom.events/ieventlistener) is removed from an [`EventTarget`](../eventtarget) while it is processing an event, it will not be triggered by the current actions. Event Listeners can never be invoked after being removed. |
| [RemoveEventListener](../../aspose.html.dom/eventtarget/removeeventlistener)(string, DOMEventHandler, bool) | This method allows the removal of event listeners from the event target. If an [`IEventListener`](../../aspose.html.dom.events/ieventlistener) is removed from an [`EventTarget`](../eventtarget) while it is processing an event, it will not be triggered by the current actions. Event Listeners can never be invoked after being removed. |
