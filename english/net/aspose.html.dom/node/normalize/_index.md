## Node.Normalize method

Puts all [`Text`](../../text/) nodes in the full depth of the sub-tree underneath this Node, including attribute nodes, into a "normal" form where only structure (e.g., [`elements`](../../element/), [`comments`](../../comment/), [`processing instructions`](../../processinginstruction/), [`CDATA sections`](../../cdatasection/), and [`entity references`](../../entityreference/)) separates [`Text`](../../text/) nodes, i.e., there are neither adjacent Text nodes nor empty Text nodes. This can be used to ensure that the DOM view of a document is the same as if it were saved and re-loaded, and is useful when operations (such as XPointer [XPointer] lookups) that depend on a particular document tree structure are to be used. If the parameter "normalize-characters" of the [`DOMConfiguration`](../../../aspose.html/configuration/) object attached to the [`Node.ownerDocument`](../ownerdocument/) is true, this method will also fully normalize the characters of the Text nodes.

```csharp
public void Normalize()
```
