## Node.CloneNode method (1 of 2)

The cloneNode() method of the Node interface returns a duplicate of the node on which this method was called. Its parameter controls if the subtree contained in a node is also cloned or not.

Cloning a node copies all of its attributes and their values, including intrinsic (inline) listeners. It does not copy event listeners added using [`addEventListener()`](../../../aspose.html.dom.events/ieventtarget/addeventlistener) or those assigned to element properties (e.g., node.onclick = someFunction). Additionally, for a [`&lt;canvas&gt;`](../../../aspose.html/htmlcanvaselement) element, the painted image is not copied.

```csharp
public Node CloneNode()
```

## Return Value

The new [`Node`](../../node) cloned. The cloned node has no parent and is not part of the document, until it is added to another node that is part of the document, using [`Node.appendChild()`](../appendchild) or a similar method.

## Node.CloneNode method (2 of 2)

The cloneNode() method of the Node interface returns a duplicate of the node on which this method was called. Its parameter controls if the subtree contained in a node is also cloned or not.

Cloning a node copies all of its attributes and their values, including intrinsic (inline) listeners. It does not copy event listeners added using [addEventListener()](M:Aspose.Html.Dom.Events.IEventTarget.AddEventListener(System.String,Aspose.Html.Dom.Events.IEventListener)) or those assigned to element properties (e.g., node.onclick = someFunction). Additionally, for a [&lt;canvas&gt;](T:Aspose.Html.HTMLCanvasElement) element, the painted image is not copied.

```csharp
public Node CloneNode(bool deep)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| deep | Boolean | If true, then the node and its whole subtree, including text that may be in child [`Text`](../../text) nodes, is also copied. |

## Return Value

The new [Node](T:Aspose.Html.Dom.Node) cloned. The cloned node has no parent and is not part of the document, until it is added to another node that is part of the document, using [Node.appendChild()](M:Aspose.Html.Dom.Node.AppendChild(Aspose.Html.Dom.Node)) or a similar method.
