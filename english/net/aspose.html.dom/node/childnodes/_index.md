## Node.ChildNodes property

The read-only childNodes property of the Node interface returns a live [`NodeList`](../../../aspose.html.collections/nodelist) of child nodes of the given element where the first child node is assigned index 0. Child nodes include elements, text and comments.

Note: The [`NodeList`](../../../aspose.html.collections/nodelist) being live means that its content is changed each time new children are added or removed.

```csharp
public NodeList ChildNodes { get; }
```

### Property Value

A live [`NodeList`](../../../aspose.html.collections/nodelist) containing the children of the node.

Note: Several calls to childNodes return the same [`NodeList`](../../../aspose.html.collections/nodelist).

### Remarks

Reference:

[DOM Standard](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/) - defines a platform-neutral model for events, aborting activities, and node trees.[DOM Standard (DOM) # dom-node-childnodes](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-node-childnodes).[GitHub](https://github.com/whatwg/dom) - repository hosts the DOM Standard.
