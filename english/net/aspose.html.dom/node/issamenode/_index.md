## Node.IsSameNode method

The isSameNode() method of the Node interface is a legacy alias the for the === strict equality operator. That is, it tests whether two nodes are the same (in other words, whether they reference the same object).

Note: There is no need to use isSameNode(); instead use the === strict equality operator.

```csharp
public bool IsSameNode(Node otherNode)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| otherNode | Node | The Node to test against. |
