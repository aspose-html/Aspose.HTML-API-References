## INodeFilter.AcceptNode method

Test whether a specified node is visible in the logical view of a TreeWalker or NodeIterator. This function will be called by the implementation of TreeWalker and NodeIterator; it is not normally called directly from user code. (Though you could do so if you wanted to use the same filter to guide your own application logic.)

```csharp
public short AcceptNode(Node n)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| n | Node | node to check to see if it passes the filter or not. |

## Return Value

a constant to determine whether the node is accepted, rejected, or skipped, as defined above.
