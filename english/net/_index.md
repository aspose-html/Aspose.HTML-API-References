## Namespaces

| Namespace | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Aspose.Html](./aspose.html/) | The Aspose.Html namespace contains classes and methods to manipulate [`HTML documents`](aspose.html/htmldocument/), whether simple or complex and on the fly. Aspose.HTML for .NET allows developers to Insert, Remove, Replace HTML nodes, extract CSS style information, Navigate through [`HTML document`](aspose.html/htmldocument/) either by [`NodeIterator`](aspose.html.dom.traversal/inodeiterator/), [`TreeWalker`](aspose.html.dom.traversal/itreewalker/) that are provided by Traversal Specifications, XPath or CSS selector queries. It also offers the scripting which allows to manipulate HTML DOM via JavaScript. As well as HTML, this API also provides the capabilities to load EPUB and MHTML. Aspose APIs are famous for their inter file format conversion features and this API also provides the capabilities to load HTML file and render the output in PDF, XPS and raster image formats including JPEG, PNG, BMP and TIFF. |
| [Aspose.Html.Collections](./aspose.html.collections/) | The **Aspose.Html.Collections** namespace consists of classes to represent, store and manipulate nodes and elements. |
| [Aspose.Html.Converters](./aspose.html.converters/) | The **Aspose.Html.Converters** namespace goal is easy access to conversion methods. It provides a wide range of conversions to the popular formats, such as PDF, XPS, image formats, etc. More specific conversion (rendering, saving) user cases are presented by well known and documented low level API functions in subject oriented namespaces. |
| [Aspose.Html.Dom](./aspose.html.dom/) | The **Aspose.Html.Dom (Document Object Model)** namespace provides API that represents and interacts with any HTML, XML or SVG documents. The DOM is a document model loaded in the browser and representing the document as a node tree, where each node represents part of the document (e.g. an element, text string, or comment). |
| [Aspose.Html.Dom.Attributes](./aspose.html.dom.attributes/) | The **Aspose.Html.Dom.Attributes** namespace contains unified attribute classes which specifies or qualifies any object (node, element, ...) feature or behavior. |
| [Aspose.Html.Dom.Canvas](./aspose.html.dom.canvas/) |  |
| [Aspose.Html.Dom.Css](./aspose.html.dom.css/) | Provides interfaces for DOM Level 2 Style Specification. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language that allows authors and users to attach style (e.g., fonts and spacing) to structured documents (e.g., HTML documents and XML applications). It supports media-specific style sheets so that authors may tailor the presentation of their documents to visual browsers, aural devices, printers, braille devices, handheld devices, etc. It also supports content positioning, table layout, features for internationalization and some properties related to user interface. By separating the presentation style of documents from the content of documents, CSS simplifies Web authoring and site maintenance. |
| [Aspose.Html.Dom.Events](./aspose.html.dom.events/) | The **Aspose.Html.Dom.Events** namespace provides objects for any events related DOM updating. It includes subscription to specific contextual information observation associated with event as well as custom events construction. |
| [Aspose.Html.Dom.Mutations](./aspose.html.dom.mutations/) | The **Aspose.Html.Dom.Mutations** provides opportunity to observe DOM mutations and getting specific callback information. |
| [Aspose.Html.Dom.Svg](./aspose.html.dom.svg/) | All classes in **Aspose.Html.Dom.Svg** namespace are based on w3c SVG2 recommendations. Using this namespace, you can load, navigate or render the SVG file as per your requirements. |
| [Aspose.Html.Dom.Svg.Collections](./aspose.html.dom.svg.collections/) | **Aspose.Html.Dom.Svg.Collections** provides access to specific generic collections. |
| [Aspose.Html.Dom.Svg.DataTypes](./aspose.html.dom.svg.datatypes/) | The namespace provides access to all SVG specific data types. |
| [Aspose.Html.Dom.Svg.Events](./aspose.html.dom.svg.events/) | The namespace consists of classes for event based interactivity like time events and zooming. |
| [Aspose.Html.Dom.Svg.Filters](./aspose.html.dom.svg.filters/) | The **Aspose.Html.Dom.Svg.Filters** namespace contains classes and interfaces related to filter effects in SVG specification. |
| [Aspose.Html.Dom.Svg.Paths](./aspose.html.dom.svg.paths/) | The **Aspose.Html.Dom.Svg.Paths** namespace describes classes for representation of outline of a shape which can be filled or stroked. A path can also be used as a clipping path, to describe animation, or position text. |
| [Aspose.Html.Dom.Svg.Saving](./aspose.html.dom.svg.saving/) | **Aspose.Html.Dom.Svg.Saving** contains secondary role classes to specify saving process. For example, save options and format in which document is saved. |
| [Aspose.Html.Dom.Traversal](./aspose.html.dom.traversal/) | The **Aspose.Html.Dom.Traversal** namespace contains methods that create iterators and tree-walkers to navigate between elements and traverse a node and its children in document order. |
| [Aspose.Html.Dom.Traversal.Filters](./aspose.html.dom.traversal.filters/) | The namespace represented by node filtering functionality. Filters are objects that know how to "filter out" nodes. If a node iterator or tree walker is given a node filter, it applies the filter before it returns the next node. If the filter says to accept the node, the traversal logic returns it; otherwise, traversal looks for the next node and pretends that the node that was rejected was not there. |
