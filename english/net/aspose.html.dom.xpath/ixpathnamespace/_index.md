## IXPathNamespace interface

The XPathNamespace interface is returned by XPathResult interfaces to represent the XPath namespace node type that DOM lacks.

```csharp
public interface IXPathNamespace
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [OwnerElement](../../aspose.html.dom.xpath/ixpathnamespace/ownerelement) { get; } | The [`Element`](../../aspose.html.dom/element) on which the namespace was in scope when it was requested. This does not change on a returned namespace node even if the document changes such that the namespace goes out of scope on that element and this node is no longer found there by XPath. |
