## IXPathNSResolver interface

The `XPathNSResolver` interface permit `prefix` strings in the expression to be properly bound to `namespaceURI` strings. [`IXPathEvaluator`](../ixpathevaluator/) can construct an implementation of [`IXPathNSResolver`](./ixpathnsresolver/) from a node, or the interface may be implemented by any application.

```csharp
public interface IXPathNSResolver
```

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [LookupNamespaceURI](../../aspose.html.dom.xpath/ixpathnsresolver/lookupnamespaceuri/)(string) | Look up the namespace URI associated to the given namespace prefix. The XPath evaluator must never call this with a `null` or empty argument, because the result of doing this is undefined. |
