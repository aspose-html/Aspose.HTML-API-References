## Converter class

Shared facade only for most often conversion scenarios. It provides a wide range of conversions to the popular formats, such as PDF, XPS, image formats, etc. More specific conversion (rendering, saving) user cases are presented by well known and documented low level API functions.

More detailed conversion specific info you can obtain on [Aspose Documentation](https://docs.aspose.com/html/net/converting-between-formats/)

public static class Converter
