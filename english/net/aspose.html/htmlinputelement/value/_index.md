## HTMLInputElement.Value property

When the `type` attribute of the element has the value "text", "file" or "password", this represents the current contents of the corresponding form control, in an interactive user agent. Changing this attribute changes the contents of the form control, but does not change the value of the HTML value attribute of the element. When the `type` attribute of the element has the value "button", "hidden", "submit", "reset", "image", "checkbox" or "radio", this represents the HTML value attribute of the element. See the value attribute definition in HTML 4.01.

```csharp
public string Value { get; set; }
```
