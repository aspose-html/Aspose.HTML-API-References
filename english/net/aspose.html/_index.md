The Aspose.Html namespace contains classes and methods to manipulate [`HTML documents`](aspose.html/htmldocument), whether simple or complex and on the fly. Aspose.HTML for .NET allows developers to Insert, Remove, Replace HTML nodes, extract CSS style information, Navigate through [`HTML document`](aspose.html/htmldocument) either by [`NodeIterator`](aspose.html.dom.traversal/inodeiterator), [`TreeWalker`](aspose.html.dom.traversal/itreewalker) that are provided by Traversal Specifications, XPath or CSS selector queries. It also offers the scripting which allows to manipulate HTML DOM via JavaScript. As well as HTML, this API also provides the capabilities to load EPUB and MHTML. Aspose APIs are famous for their inter file format conversion features and this API also provides the capabilities to load HTML file and render the output in PDF, XPS and raster image formats including JPEG, PNG, BMP and TIFF.
