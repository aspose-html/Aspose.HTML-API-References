As suggested by HTML 4.01 to include images authors may use the OBJECT element or the IMG element.

## HTMLDocument.Images property

A collection of all the `IMG` elements in a document. The behavior is limited to `IMG` elements for backwards compatibility. As suggested by [[HTML 4.01](http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224)], to include images, authors may use the `OBJECT` element or the `IMG` element. Therefore, it is recommended not to use this attribute to find the images in the document but `getElementsByTagName` with HTML 4.01 or `getElementsByTagNameNS` with XHTML 1.0.

```csharp
public HTMLCollection Images { get; }
```
