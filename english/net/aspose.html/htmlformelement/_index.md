## HTMLFormElement class

The `FORM` element encompasses behavior similar to a collection and an element. It provides direct access to the contained form controls as well as the attributes of the form element. See the FORM element definition in HTML 4.01.

See also the [Document object Model (DOM) Level 2 HTML Specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-DOM-Level-2-HTML-20030109).

public class HTMLFormElement : HTMLElement, IHTMLFormElement
