| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [AddEventListener](../../aspose.html.dom/eventtarget/addeventlistener/)(*string, [IEventListener](../../aspose.html.dom.events/ieventlistener/)*) | Sets up a function that will be called whenever the specified event is delivered to the target. |
| [AddEventListener](../../aspose.html.dom/eventtarget/addeventlistener/)(*string, [DOMEventHandler](../../aspose.html.dom.events/domeventhandler/), bool*) | Sets up a function that will be called whenever the specified event is delivered to the target. |

| [InsertBefore](../../aspose.html.dom/node/insertbefore/)(*[Node](../../aspose.html.dom/node/), [Node](../../aspose.html.dom/node/)*) | Inserts the node before the existing child node child. If child is null, insert node at the end of the list of children. If child is a DocumentFragment object, all of its children are inserted, in the same order, before child. If the child is already in the tree, it is first removed. |
| [IsDefaultNamespace](../../aspose.html.dom/node/isdefaultnamespace/)(*string*) | This method checks if the specified namespaceURI is the default namespace or not. |
| [IsEqualNode](../../aspose.html.dom/node/isequalnode/)(*[Node](../../aspose.html.dom/node/)*) | Tests whether two nodes are equal. This method tests for equality of nodes, not sameness (i.e., whether the two nodes are references to the same object) which can be tested with Node.isSameNode(). All nodes that are the same will also be equal, though the reverse may not be true. |
| [IsSameNode](../../aspose.html.dom/node/issamenode/)(*[Node](../../aspose.html.dom/node/)*) | Method is a legacy alias the for the === strict equality operator. That is, it tests whether two nodes are the same (in other words, whether they reference the same object). |

| [LookupPrefix](../../aspose.html.dom/node/lookupprefix/)(*string*) | Look up the prefix associated to the given namespace URI, starting from this node. The default namespace declarations are ignored by this method. See Namespace Prefix Lookup for details on the algorithm used by this method. |
| [Normalize](../../aspose.html.dom/node/normalize/)() | Puts all Text nodes in the full depth of the sub-tree underneath this Node, including attribute nodes, into a "normal" form where only structure (e.g., elements, comments, processing instructions, CDATA sections, and entity references) separates Text nodes, i.e., there are neither adjacent Text nodes nor empty Text nodes. This can be used to ensure that the DOM view of a document is the same as if it were saved and re-loaded, and is useful when operations (such as XPointer [XPointer] lookups) that depend on a particular document tree structure are to be used. If the parameter "normalize-characters" of the DOMConfiguration object attached to the Node.ownerDocument is true, this method will also fully normalize the characters of the Text nodes. |
| [QuerySelector](../../aspose.html.dom/element/queryselector/)(*string*) | Returns the first Element in document, which match selector |

If an [`IEventListener`](../../aspose.html.dom.events/ieventlistener/) is removed from an [`EventTarget`](../../aspose.html.dom/eventtarget/) while it is processing an event, it will not be triggered by the current actions. Event Listeners can never be invoked after being removed. |
| [RemoveEventListener](../../aspose.html.dom/eventtarget/removeeventlistener/)(*string, [DOMEventHandler](../../aspose.html.dom.events/domeventhandler/), bool*) | This method allows the removal of event listeners from the event target. If an [`IEventListener`](../../aspose.html.dom.events/ieventlistener/) is removed from an [`EventTarget`](../../aspose.html.dom/eventtarget/) while it is processing an event, it will not be triggered by the current actions. Event Listeners can never be invoked after being removed. |
| [RemoveEventListener](../../aspose.html.dom/eventtarget/removeeventlistener/)(*string, [IEventListener](../../aspose.html.dom.events/ieventlistener/), bool*) | This method allows the removal of event listeners from the event target.

If newChild is a DocumentFragment object, oldChild is replaced by all of the DocumentFragment children, which are inserted in the same order. If the newChild is already in the tree, it is first removed. |
| [SetAttribute](../../aspose.html.dom/element/setattribute/)(*string, string*) | Adds a new attribute. If an attribute with that name is already present in the element, its value is changed to be that of the value parameter |
| [SetAttributeNode](../../aspose.html.dom/element/setattributenode/)(*[Attr](../../aspose.html.dom/attr/)*) | Adds a new attribute node. If an attribute with that name (nodeName) is already present in the element, it is replaced by the new one. |
