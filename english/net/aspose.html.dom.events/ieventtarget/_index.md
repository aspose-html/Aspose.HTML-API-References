## IEventTarget interface

The [`EventTarget`](../../aspose.html.dom/eventtarget) interface is implemented by all Nodes in an implementation which supports the DOM Event Model. Therefore, this interface can be obtained by using binding-specific casting methods on an instance of the Node interface. The interface allows registration and removal of Event Listeners on an [`EventTarget`](../../aspose.html.dom/eventtarget) and dispatch of events to that [`IEventTarget`](../ieventtarget).

```csharp
public interface IEventTarget
```

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [AddEventListener](addeventlistener)(string, IEventListener) | This method allows the registration of event listeners on the event target. |
| [AddEventListener](addeventlistener)(string, IEventListener, bool) | This method allows the registration of event listeners on the event target. |
| [DispatchEvent](dispatchevent)(Event) | This method allows the dispatch of events into the implementations event model. |
| [RemoveEventListener](removeeventlistener)(string, IEventListener) | This method allows the removal of event listeners from the event target. If an [`IEventListener`](../ieventlistener) is removed from an [`EventTarget`](../../aspose.html.dom/eventtarget) while it is processing an event, it will not be triggered by the current actions. Event Listeners can never be invoked after being removed. |
