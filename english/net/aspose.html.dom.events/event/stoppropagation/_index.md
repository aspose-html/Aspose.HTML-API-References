## Event.StopPropagation method

The `StopPropagation` method is used prevent further propagation of an event during event flow.

```csharp
public void StopPropagation()
```

## Remarks

If this method is called by any [`IEventListener`](../../ieventlistener/) the event will cease propagating through the tree. The event will complete dispatch to all listeners on the current [`IEventTarget`](../../ieventtarget/) before event flow stops. This method may be used during any stage of event flow.
