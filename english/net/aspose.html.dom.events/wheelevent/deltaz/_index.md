## WheelEvent.DeltaZ property

In user agents where the default action of the wheel event is to scroll, the value MUST be the measurement along the z-axis (in pixels, lines, or pages) to be scrolled in the case where the event is not cancelled. Otherwise, this is an implementation-specific measurement (in pixels, lines, or pages) of the movement of a wheel device around the z-axis.

```csharp
public double DeltaZ { get; }
```

### Property Value

The deltaZ attribute.
