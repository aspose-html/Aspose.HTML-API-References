## WheelEvent class

The WheelEvent interface provides specific contextual information associated with wheel events. To create an instance of the WheelEvent interface, use the WheelEvent constructor, passing an optional WheelEventInit dictionary.

```csharp
public class WheelEvent : MouseEvent
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [WheelEvent](wheelevent)(string) | Initializes a new instance of the [`WheelEvent`](../wheelevent) class. |
| [WheelEvent](wheelevent)(string, IDictionary&lt;string, object&gt;) |  |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [DeltaMode](deltamode) { get; } | The deltaMode attribute contains an indication of the units of measurement for the delta values. The default value is DOM_DELTA_PIXEL (pixels). |
| [DeltaX](deltax) { get; } | In user agents where the default action of the wheel event is to scroll, the value MUST be the measurement along the x-axis (in pixels, lines, or pages) to be scrolled in the case where the event is not cancelled. Otherwise, this is an implementation-specific measurement (in pixels, lines, or pages) of the movement of a wheel device around the x-axis. |
| [DeltaY](deltay) { get; } | In user agents where the default action of the wheel event is to scroll, the value MUST be the measurement along the y-axis (in pixels, lines, or pages) to be scrolled in the case where the event is not cancelled. Otherwise, this is an implementation-specific measurement (in pixels, lines, or pages) of the movement of a wheel device around the y-axis. |
| [DeltaZ](deltaz) { get; } | In user agents where the default action of the wheel event is to scroll, the value MUST be the measurement along the z-axis (in pixels, lines, or pages) to be scrolled in the case where the event is not cancelled. Otherwise, this is an implementation-specific measurement (in pixels, lines, or pages) of the movement of a wheel device around the z-axis. |
