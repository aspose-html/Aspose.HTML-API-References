The path methods of the CanvasRenderingContext2D interface are present on this interface as well and are allowing you to create paths that you can retain and replay as required on a canvas. |

| interface [ICanvasRenderingContext2D](./icanvasrenderingcontext2d) | The ICanvasRenderingContext2D interface is used for drawing rectangles, text, images and other objects onto the canvas element. It provides the 2D rendering context for the drawing surface of a canvas element. |
| interface [IImageData](./iimagedata) | Creates an ImageData object from a given Uint8ClampedArray and the size of the image it contains. If no array is given, it creates an image of a black rectangle. |
