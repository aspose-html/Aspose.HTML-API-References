## ICanvasPathMethods.BezierCurveTo method

Adds a cubic Bézier curve to the path. It requires three points. The first two points are control points and the third one is the end point. The starting point is the last point in the current path, which can be changed using moveTo() before creating the Bézier curve.

```csharp
public void BezierCurveTo(double cp1x, double cp1y, double cp2x, double cp2y, double x, double y)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| cp1x | Double | The x axis of the coordinate for the first control point. |
| cp1y | Double | The y axis of the coordinate for the first control point. |
| cp2x | Double | The x axis of the coordinate for the second control point. |
| cp2y | Double | The y axis of the coordinate for the second control point. |
| x | Double | The x axis of the coordinate for the end point. |
| y | Double | The y axis of the coordinate for the end point. |
