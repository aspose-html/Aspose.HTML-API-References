## ICanvasPathMethods.Arc method (1 of 2)

Adds an arc to the path which is centered at (x, y) position with radius r starting at startAngle and ending at endAngle going in the given direction by anticlockwise (defaulting to clockwise).

```csharp
public void Arc(double x, double y, double radius, double startAngle, double endAngle)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| x | Double | The x coordinate of the arc's center. |
| y | Double | The y coordinate of the arc's center. |
| radius | Double | The arc's radius. |
| startAngle | Double | The angle at which the arc starts, measured clockwise from the positive x axis and expressed in radians. |
| endAngle | Double | The angle at which the arc ends, measured clockwise from the positive x axis and expressed in radians. |

```csharp
public void Arc(double x, double y, double radius, double startAngle, double endAngle, 
    bool counterclockwise)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| x | Double | The x coordinate of the arc's center. |
| y | Double | The y coordinate of the arc's center. |
| radius | Double | The arc's radius. |
| startAngle | Double | The angle at which the arc starts, measured clockwise from the positive x axis and expressed in radians. |
| endAngle | Double | The angle at which the arc ends, measured clockwise from the positive x axis and expressed in radians. |
| counterclockwise | Boolean | Causes the arc to be drawn counter-clockwise between the two angles. By default it is drawn clockwise. |
