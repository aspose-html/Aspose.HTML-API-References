description: Creates a new clipping region by calculating the intersection of the current clipping region and the area described by the path using the nonzero winding number rule. Open subpaths must be implicitly closed when computing the clipping region without affecting the actual subpaths. The new clipping region replaces the current clipping region.

## Clip() {#clip}

Creates a new clipping region by calculating the intersection of the current clipping region and the area described by the path, using the non-zero winding number rule. Open subpaths must be implicitly closed when computing the clipping region, without affecting the actual subpaths. The new clipping region replaces the current clipping region.

```csharp
public void Clip()
```

## Clip(CanvasFillRule) {#clip_1}

Creates a new clipping region by calculating the intersection of the current clipping region and the area described by the path, using the non-zero winding number rule. Open subpaths must be implicitly closed when computing the clipping region, without affecting the actual subpaths. The new clipping region replaces the current clipping region.

```csharp
public void Clip(CanvasFillRule fillRule)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| fillRule | CanvasFillRule | The algorithm by which to determine if a point is inside a path or outside a path |

## Clip(Path2D, CanvasFillRule) {#clip_2}

Creates a new clipping region by calculating the intersection of the current clipping region and the area described by the path, using the non-zero winding number rule. Open subpaths must be implicitly closed when computing the clipping region, without affecting the actual subpaths. The new clipping region replaces the current clipping region.

```csharp
public void Clip(Path2D path, CanvasFillRule fillRule)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| path | Path2D | A Path2D path to clip. |
| fillRule | CanvasFillRule | The algorithm by which to determine if a point is inside a path or outside a path. |
