## ICSSStyleSheet.InsertRule method

The CSSStyleSheet.insertRule() method inserts a new CSS rule into the current style sheet, with some restrictions.

Note: Although insertRule() is exclusively a method of [`CSSStyleSheet`](../../icssstylesheet), it actually inserts the rule into CSSStyleSheet.cssRules — its internal [`CSSRuleList`](../../icssrulelist).

```csharp
public long InsertRule(string rule, int index)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| rule | String | A String containing the rule to be inserted. What the inserted rule must contain depends on its type: |
| index | Int32 | A positive integer less than or equal to stylesheet.cssRules.length, representing the newly inserted rule's position in CSSStyleSheet.cssRules. The default is 0. |

### Return Value

The newly inserted rule's index within the stylesheet's rule-list.

### Remarks

[CSSOM](https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom/) defines APIs (including generic parsing and serialization rules) for Media Queries, Selectors, and of course CSS itself.
