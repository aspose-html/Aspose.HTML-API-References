## ICSSRule interface

The CSSRule interface is the abstract base interface for any type of CSS statement. This includes both rule sets and at-rules. An implementation is expected to preserve all rules specified in a CSS style sheet, even if the rule is not recognized by the parser. Unrecognized rules are represented using the !:ICSSUnknownRule interface.

```csharp
public interface ICSSRule
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [CSSText](../../aspose.html.dom.css/icssrule/csstext) { get; set; } | The parsable textual representation of the rule. This reflects the current state of the rule and not its initial value. |
| [ParentRule](../../aspose.html.dom.css/icssrule/parentrule) { get; } | If this rule is contained inside another rule (e.g. a style rule inside an @media block), this is the containing rule. If this rule is not nested inside any other rules, this returns null. |
| [ParentStyleSheet](../../aspose.html.dom.css/icssrule/parentstylesheet) { get; } | The style sheet that contains this rule. |
| [Type](../../aspose.html.dom.css/icssrule/type) { get; } | The type of the rule, as defined above. The expectation is that binding-specific casting methods can be used to cast down from an instance of the CSSRule interface to the specific derived interface implied by the type. |
