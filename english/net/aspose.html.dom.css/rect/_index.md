## Rect class

The Rect interface is used to represent any rect value. This interface reflects the values in the underlying style property. Hence, modifications made to the [`CSSPrimitiveValue`](../cssprimitivevalue) objects modify the style property.

```csharp
public class Rect : DOMObject
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Bottom](bottom) { get; } | This attribute is used for the bottom of the rect. |
| [Left](left) { get; } | This attribute is used for the left of the rect. |
| [Right](right) { get; } | This attribute is used for the right of the rect. |
| [Top](top) { get; } | This attribute is used for the top of the rect. |
