## ICSS2Properties.BackgroundAttachment property

If a background image is specified, this property specifies whether it is fixed with regard to the viewport ('fixed') or scrolls along with the document ('scroll').

Even if the image is fixed, it is still only visible when it is in the background or padding area of the element. Thus, unless the image is tiled ('background-repeat: repeat'), it may be invisible.

```csharp
public string BackgroundAttachment { get; set; }
```

### Return Value

background-attachment property
