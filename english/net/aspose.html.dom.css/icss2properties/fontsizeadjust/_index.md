description: In bicameral scripts the subjective apparent size and legibility of a font are less dependent on their fontsize value than on the value of their xheight or more usefully on the ratio of these two values called the aspect value font size divided by xheight. The higher the aspect value the more likely it is that a font at smaller sizes will be legible. Inversely faces with a lower aspect value will become illegible more rapidly below a given threshold size than faces with a higher aspect value. Straightforward font substitution that relies on font size alone may lead to illegible characters.

## ICSS2Properties.FontSizeAdjust property

In bicameral scripts, the subjective apparent size and legibility of a font are less dependent on their 'font-size' value than on the value of their 'x-height', or, more usefully, on the ratio of these two values, called the aspect value (font size divided by x-height). The higher the aspect value, the more likely it is that a font at smaller sizes will be legible. Inversely, faces with a lower aspect value will become illegible more rapidly below a given threshold size than faces with a higher aspect value. Straightforward font substitution that relies on font size alone may lead to illegible characters.

```csharp
public string FontSizeAdjust { get; set; }
```
