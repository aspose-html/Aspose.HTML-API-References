## ICSS2Properties.OutlineWidth property

The outline created with the outline properties is drawn "over" a box, i.e., the outline is always on top, and doesn't influence the position or size of the box, or of any other boxes. Therefore, displaying or suppressing outlines does not cause reflow.

```csharp
public string OutlineWidth { get; set; }
```

### Return Value

outline-width property
