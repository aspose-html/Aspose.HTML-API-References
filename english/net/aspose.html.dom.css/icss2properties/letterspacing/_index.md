## ICSS2Properties.LetterSpacing property

This property specifies spacing behavior between text characters. Values have the following meanings:

normal - The spacing is the normal spacing for the current font. This value allows the user agent to alter the space between characters in order to justify text.

[length](https://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512/syndata.html#value-def-length) - This value indicates inter-character space in addition to the default space between characters. Values may be negative, but there may be implementation-specific limits. User agents may not further increase or decrease the inter-character space in order to justify text.

```csharp
public string LetterSpacing { get; set; }
```

## Return Value
