second_title: Aspose.HTML for .NET API Reference
description: ICSS2Properties property. Specifies variation in average pitch. The perceived pitch of a human voice is determined by the fundamental frequency and typically has a value of 120Hz for a male voice and 210Hz for a female voice. Human languages are spoken with varying inflection and pitch these variations convey additional meaning and emphasis. Thus a highly animated voice i.e. one that is heavily inflected displays a high pitch range. This property specifies the range over which these variations occur i.e. how much the fundamental frequency may deviate from the average pitch
