## IMediaList interface

The MediaList interface provides the abstraction of an ordered collection of media, without defining or constraining how this collection is implemented. An empty list is the same as a list that contains the medium "all".

```csharp
public interface IMediaList : IEnumerable<string>
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Item](../../aspose.html.dom.css/imedialist/item) { get; } | Returns the indexth in the list. If index is greater than or equal to the number of media in the list, this returns null. The media index. |
| [Length](../../aspose.html.dom.css/imedialist/length) { get; } | The number of media in the list. The range of valid media is 0 to length-1 inclusive. |
| [MediaText](../../aspose.html.dom.css/imedialist/mediatext) { get; } | The parsable textual representation of the media list. This is a comma-separated list of media. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [AppendMedium](../../aspose.html.dom.css/imedialist/appendmedium)(string) | Adds the medium newMedium to the end of the list. If the newMedium is already used, it is first removed. |
