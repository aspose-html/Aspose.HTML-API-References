## IStyleSheetList interface

The StyleSheetList interface represents a list of [`CSSStyleSheet`](../icssstylesheet/) objects. An instance of this object can be returned by [`Document.styleSheets`](../../aspose.html.dom/document/stylesheets/).

The object’s supported property indices are the numbers in the range zero to one less than the number of CSS style sheets represented by the collection. If there are no such CSS style sheets, then there are no supported property indices.

```csharp
public interface IStyleSheetList : IEnumerable<IStyleSheet>
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Item](../../aspose.html.dom.css/istylesheetlist/item/) { get; } | The item(index) method must return the indexth [`CSS style sheet`](../icssstylesheet/) in the collection. If there is no indexth object in the collection, then the method must return null. |
| [Length](../../aspose.html.dom.css/istylesheetlist/length/) { get; } | The length attribute must return the number of CSS style sheets represented by the collection. The range of valid child stylesheet indices is 0 to length-1 inclusive. |
