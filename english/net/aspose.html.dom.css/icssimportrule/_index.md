## ICSSImportRule interface

The CSSImportRule interface represents a @import rule within a CSS style sheet. The @import rule is used to import style rules from other style sheets.

public interface ICSSImportRule : ICSSRule
```

| [Href](../../aspose.html.dom.css/icssimportrule/href) { get; } | The read-only href property of the CSSImportRule interface returns the URL specified by the @import at-rule. |
| [Media](../../aspose.html.dom.css/icssimportrule/media) { get; } | The read-only media property of the CSSImportRule interface returns a MediaList object, containing the value of the media attribute of the associated stylesheet. |
