## ILinkStyle interface

The LinkStyle interface provides a mechanism by which a style sheet can be retrieved from the node responsible for linking it into a document. An instance of the LinkStyle interface can be obtained using binding-specific casting methods on an instance of a linking node (HTMLLinkElement, HTMLStyleElement or ProcessingInstruction in DOM Level 2).

```csharp
public interface ILinkStyle
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
