## ITrueTypeFont interface

Declares methods for working with TrueType fonts.

```csharp
public interface ITrueTypeFont
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [DataSize](../../aspose.html.drawing/itruetypefont/datasize/) { get; } | Gets the size of the font data in bytes. |
| [FamilyName](../../aspose.html.drawing/itruetypefont/familyname/) { get; } | Gets the name of the font family. |
| [FullFontName](../../aspose.html.drawing/itruetypefont/fullfontname/) { get; } | Full font name is generally represented as combination of Family and Subfamily names. |
| [Style](../../aspose.html.drawing/itruetypefont/style/) { get; } | Get the font style that combines the values of the font-face rule and data from the font. |
| [SubFamilyName](../../aspose.html.drawing/itruetypefont/subfamilyname/) { get; } | The Subfamily name distinguishes the font in a group with the same Family name. This is assumed to address style (italic, oblique) and weight (light, bold, black, etc.). A font with no particular differences in weight or style should have the string "Regular". |
