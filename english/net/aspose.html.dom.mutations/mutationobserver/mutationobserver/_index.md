## MutationObserver constructor

Constructs a MutationObserver object and sets its [`MutationCallback`](../../mutationcallback) to callback. The callback is invoked with a list of MutationRecord objects as first argument and the constructed MutationObserver object as second argument. It is invoked after nodes registered with the !:Observe(Node, IMutationObserverInit) method, are mutated.

```csharp
public MutationObserver(MutationCallback callback)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| callback | MutationCallback | The callback. |
